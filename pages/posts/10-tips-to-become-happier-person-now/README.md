### 1. Focus on the now

Too many times we think of the future. This is not a bad idea, to plan and prepare is such a smart idea for anyone but we sometimes get to overwhelmed with the future that hasn&#x2019;t even come.

Other times we are stuck in the past and not moving on. It is also time to let go of the past and move on. Focus on the now. Enjoy the ice cream, enjoy the presence of your lover, have fun answering your examination questions. Be happy now.

Let tomorrow take care of itself, that past already has.

### 2. Help someone

Try a little kindness and see how much it empowers you. You become a happier person instantly knowing that someone has been positively touched.

Assist someone in their assignment, render some financial assistance where you can, send someone to school.

### 3. Let go of bitterness and hurt

Hurts and bitterness can drain your positive energy. They can rob you of the chance to be happier. Release yourself of the bitterness and hurt. Let things go so that you can focus on yourself.

### 4. Get away for a while

Have a retreat, a vacation. Get away from the noise for a while. Too much of workload and constant working can cause you to burn up.

Shake yourself up a little and go for a walk. Jog or do some form of exercise to take your mind off the volume of unending tasks.
