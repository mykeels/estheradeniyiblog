Needless to say, we are in such a fast paced world. It&#x2019;s so difficult to keep on top of this game and be more productive at work if you are a &#x2018;busy&#x2019; person. Actually, &#x2018;busy&#x2019; is just a word, read this blog post on[ how to be done with the &#x2018;I am too busy&#x2019; cliche.](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-to-be-done-with-i-am-too-busy-cliche?m=1) Staying productive despite the noise here and there can cause a lot of stress, but with little adjustments you can achieve both productivity and a less stressful life.

I have met people who are although very engaged stay productive at work. I recently had a chit chat with a Professor and some of the tips handed down to me, I will share with you in this blog post. She acknowledged how stressful indeed it is to keep up and how much of wisdom she had to apply to keep both family and career moving.

People who have 9-5 jobs and also run a side hustle may burn out very frequently. This is because there are a lot of deadlines to meet, expectations to grant and promises to fulfill. Here, let&#x2019;s dive straight into how to stay more productive at work despite the workload.

## Have a To-do list/note

When you have so many things to do in your head, there is this very great possibility of you running around doing nothing. Write down all you need to do for the day, add more as they come. Keep less things in your head and more in your note or table journal.

## Learn to say no

You don&#x2019;t always have to take on more and more tasks until you simply drop brain dead. You can politely decline extra responsibilities that will ruin your performance in the existing ones. Saying no does not mean that you are lazy, it only means that you take productivity seriously and you are ready to give your best. An understanding boss and client can see through you and what you are trying to do.

## Schedule ahead

Don&#x2019;t just try to meet up, schedule ahead. This helps for when you just don&#x2019;t want to move an inch. It also helps you clear your head for other tasks. Scheduling is such a great way to take your mind off a lot of work, the result is that you are more productive at work.

## Prioritize

Don&#x2019;t try to do everything all at once, this will reduce your productivity. Start from more important to least important. You have to be able to objectively assess the situation and get to do what demands your attention immediately.

## Give yourself a break

As ironic as this may sound, it is very important. Take time to rest and refuel. Go on retreats and get more inspiration on how to handle the numerous tasks.

## Ask for help

You really don&#x2019;t need to be a super woman. Just delegate tasks to people who are able to handle it faster and better. It is very important that you know how to harness efficiency out of those you work with at home and at work.

Be ready to take active steps to be relevant while you juggle in between tasks. Staying productive at work is not as herculean as it seems, you only need to make necessary lifestyle changes.

What have you resolved to do to stay more productive at work? Would you please share with me in the comments section?
