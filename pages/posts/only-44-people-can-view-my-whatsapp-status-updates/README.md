When someone comes to complain about what I put on my platform off that platform, I wait for 3 days and then take them off it. This is what I mean, you view my **whatsapp status update**, you don&#x2019;t respond to it right on whatsapp, you come offline to rant about it, I wait for 3 days, if I still feel the same way (getting you off), I do just that.

I never forget, I will remember to do it. I am so proud to be that type of petty, I am sorry too. At least, people won&#x2019;t go and have hypertension over my matter.

This time around, I didn&#x2019;t bother blocking or waiting for 3 days, I just went to &#x201C;only share with&#x2026;&#x201D; It means that only 44 people can see my whatsapp status. If you want me to teach you how to show or hide whatsapp status from selected contacts, please say in the comments section.

I also don&#x2019;t like it when I don&#x2019;t know if you viewed my status or not (because your receipt is off).

Just this morning I realized that I would prefer my whatsapp status to not be as public as my other social media accounts. I didn&#x2019;t really get that it was okay to want only a few people to see some of your other sides. I don&#x2019;t think it spells you as hypocrite, I think it just helps you draw the line and define how much of information a set of people can have of you.

I can be very extra and expressive. I think I just want to share that weird, extra, unpredictable, crazy, silly and unworthy side of me with only 44 people. On some days. I can be stupid. I unfortunately [live in a world that asks me to be as prim and proper](https://estheradeniyi.com/stop-trying-to-please-everyone-it-never/) as I can be. It&#x2019;s so limiting and unfair and judgmental.

Let me give you the full gist.

I had made a very silly video of me yesterday. I was tying a wrapper, the Nigerian kinda local wrapper. So, there I was giving a short recap of the day and my thoughts. I got to work to have my colleagues make snide comments. I wish I wasn&#x2019;t too sensitive to mockery. I wish, I wish. I wish I was just the girl who never bothers about what people say.

I know people who don&#x2019;t defend their human sides, that&#x2019;s not just me and it is distracting. I want to be able to not give a damn but since I don&#x2019;t know how to, I am going to allow myself be myself.

So, I will add people as long as my social comfort can allow, one at a time. But for one, work colleagues are out. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I love these guys, at least, most of them but ehm, I don&#x2019;t know if I want them as intimate as that. I think I just want us talking about work stuff and just a few personal things.

This is one of those rants I don&#x2019;t know how to end. Let me go and look for the image to use for this post. Tiring stuffs!
