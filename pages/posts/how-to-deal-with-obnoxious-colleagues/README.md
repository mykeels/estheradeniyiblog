 It is actually amazing how our backgrounds have shaped us to
 become who we are. Most of the things we picked up, either good or bad, as
 children, have all lived with us and in a way shaped us today. &#x201C;No man is an
 Island&#x201D;, as the popular saying goes. It is therefore unquestionable that we
 will have to deal with different people from all walks of life, day in and out.

 An informal meeting or union may not necessarily be binding
 as any party can choose to walk away if it happens that the parties in question
 are synonymous to parallel lines in thoughts, ideas and actions. The same
 cannot be said in the formal sphere as in the case of one&#x2019;s place of work.

 In fact, when the HR asks during the interview if there will
 be a problem working in a team, they always forget to put the clause that says
 the person may be really annoying at times. Lol. The truth is we will always
 come across annoying people all the time that avoiding them is almost impossible.

 How do we then deal with such in the workplace? It would be
 an easy thing if we could just ignore them and avoid them totally, but it is
 almost impossible to because more often than not, you would have to work
 together. There are other ways one can deal with this issue instead of using
 the avoidance rule.

 1. Do not correct them in the presence of others. Most
 times, this move backfires as they feel you are only trying to ridicule them.
 Look for a time when they are in a good mood and start a chat in that line.

 2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
 Always expect people to annoy you. Yea, it seems
 weird, as to why one should naturally expect this. But the truth is when you
 are psychologically prepared for it, it matters little when it is actually
 being done in reality.

 3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
 Take an intentional break. A break may be in
 form of a walk to another part of the office to meet another colleague while
 the obnoxious situation fizzles out with time. It could just be a three minutes&#x2019;
 walk away from your table.

 4.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
 Stay professional. This will help in a
 long way and pass a message across to others that no matter how annoying the
 situation is, you remain as professional as possible by sticking to official issues.

 5.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
 Do not give them room to annoy. We must also
 admit that sometimes we are also part of those who may aid the process of being
 annoyed through comments, actions and inactions, which may lead to the second
 party becoming obnoxious.

 6.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
 Sometimes obnoxious people do not know they are actually
 obnoxious, it is therefore necessary to avoid the general office gossips totally,
 and that alone will limit the type of attitude they bring to your table.

 7.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
 If you happen to be a likeable person, chances
 are that people would want a relationship with you at all cost and their demand
 for that relationship may become annoying at times. You have only one answer &#x2013;
 tell them you are not interested.

 The list of dealing with annoying people, especially at the
 work place, is not exhaustive. We must realize people are different just like
 our faces are. Therefore, we must keep looking for ways to stay and remain
 sane.
