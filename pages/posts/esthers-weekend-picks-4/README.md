Hey!

How&#x2019;s it going this weekend? It has been a generally fulfilling week for me overall.

I have one very major takeaway from this week and I would love to share this with you. This is another dimension to [self-care](https://estheradeniyi.com/self-care-tips-for-bad-days/). I am learning to be self-loving in the way I achieve my daily goals.

So I am the one to rush through everything. If I am supposed to be at the mall, for example, the end goal is to be at the mall but the process of getting there involves that I take a bath, dress up and get moving. In all of these processes, it doesn&#x2019;t matter that I am not late, I rush them still.

I am learning to enjoy and savor every process because in the end, the goal isn&#x2019;t only all that matters, how we achieve the goal matters too. In the process of being intentional about my dressing up, I might get to realize that a particular outfit could do better.

In enjoying the process, I might as well spot paleness in my eyes or check out a recent pimple. You know, this is the cheapest type of self-care.

This week, I have got some very interesting things to share with you, I hope you like them.

1. I plan to start [Funmi&#x2019;s green juice](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByCwa-XFWlW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) 3-week program on Monday. You may join if you want, it&#x2019;s free.

2. This is a whole sermon, y&#x2019;all!

3. Kodi Lee&#x2019;s golden buzzer audition is worth the hype

4. Dimma Umeh&#x2019;s new minimalist apartment is goals

5. Would you love to attend the [Inside Out worship](https://estheradeniyi.com/event/the-inside-out-worship-experience-by-coza/) experience by COZA in Lagos?

6. Do you remember this old A one advert? I think it was excellent even as at the time.
