It&#x2019;s The Experience 12 and I want to close my eyes. Such a shame, I have never been to any one at all. One of my apprehensions is that I hate crowds. Two, I am so scared of being where everyone knows everyone would be, security, you know. Three, I can&#x2019;t do all night. I will suffer it for many days.

So, I am thinking, to go or to not go. My roommates are already doing formation to spite me ooooooh. They are like, why won&#x2019;t I ever want to go to The Experience 12 when I am even in Lagos? They are indirectly telling me that something is doing me and that&#x2019;s okay. I need to hear that.

To say I am impressed with the turn out of The Experience is to say the least. Do you know that The Experience is now the largest musical concert in Africa? Wow wow wow. Later you will come and say nothing good comes out of Nigeria o.

The Experience debuted in December 2006 and has since then been growing stronger. Jesus Christ is indeed in Nigeria! The Experience is convened and hosted by Pastor Paul Adefarasin, the general overseer of [House on the Rock](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/the-african-praise-experience-2017-by). May God bless him for Nigeria.
