In this day and age, everyone has
 student loan debt out of college. For women, however, this is only part of the
 problem. Along with the income gap and leave policies, it&#x2019;s can be nearly
 impossible to get out of student loan debt or other types of credit card debt.

New reports indicate that around 44
 million borrowers own a total or $1.3 trillion in student loans. Specially,
 women over men hold around two-thirds of that entire debt, which is a number
 over $800 billion. Part of the reason this exists is because women have a
 tougher time paying off the debt.

Paying
 Student Loans After College

[Reports](https://lendedu.com/news/race-gender-paying-for-college/) indicate that women pay off debts slower than men. Part of
 this is due to the gender pay gap. Women can work full time with a college
 degree and still make 26 percent less than a man. Lower pay means less money
 for debt repayment.

In the 1-4 years after graduation, men
 pay off around 38 percent of their debt, while women can only afford to pay off
 around 31 percent, on average. This also means that default rates are higher
 for women than men, especially among minority groups of women.

While there are creative ways to pay
 off student loans and other debts, not earning enough money simply makes things
 more difficult. Since women have less money to put towards a debt, those debts
 are going to take longer to pay off. Therefore, more interest will accrue on
 the debt.

The
 Gender Pay Gap

Most people know that men are paid more
 than women over a lifetime, but what does that really mean? Do women choose
 lower paying jobs? What does the gender bias have to do with a paycheck?

According to the [AAUW](http://www.aauw.org/) (American Association of University Women), women were only
 paid around 80 percent of what men were paid in 2016. The gap has moved closer
 since the 1970s, but this is mainly due to more women seeking higher education.

While these women are making more,
 they&#x2019;re also paying off more student loans. Between 1960 and 2016, it looked
 like the pay gap would become equal by 2059, but based on a slower increase
 since 2001, that year could be closer to 2119.

Present day, the gap is closest in New
 York and California (89 percent) and furthest in Utah and Louisiana (70
 percent).

Leave
 Policies For Women

Beyond crushing student loans debts and
 less income to pay them off, women must also consider leave policies at work.
 CNN [reports](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/30/opinions/trump-budget-paid-leave-calder-opinion/) that &#x201C;government-mandated paid leave programs harm young
 women, whether they&#x2019;re available to fathers or not.&#x201D;

Generally speaking, the parental leave
 policy is associated with leave-taking and childbearing. These two advantages
 are seen on paper as lost labor and increase health care costs for employers.

While sexism is something that should
 be fought, the numbers may encourage employers to reconsider women in terms of
 hiring, promoting, training, or pay increases, which will continue to hurt all
 women.

Currently, preventative measures are
 being taken in Congress to fight these issues. It&#x2019;s possible that reforming
 occupational licensing laws, relaxing zoning regulations, or the potential [Working
 Families Flexibility Act of 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1180/text)
 will help expectant parents bank overtime hours like a union career.

Ways
 To Improve The Gender Gap

All in all, the overall problem has a
 solution, but it can take time. If the government raises the minimum wage,
 raises the tipped minimum wage, supports fair scheduling practices, create sick
 days legislation, or create a national paid family medical leave insurance
 program, things could move faster.

For individual women, however, there
 are other methods to move things along. Men negotiate their salaries four times
 as often as women do. While a [new
 poll](http://time.com/money/4285843/gender-pay-gap-excuses-wrong/) found that 83 percent of women believe
 it&#x2019;s important to negotiate their salaries, only 41 percent of women actually
 did it. Part of this reason falls on social standings.

The problem here is that many women
 feel they will look ungrateful or pushy at the office if they do negotiate.
 However, that doesn&#x2019;t mean they shouldn&#x2019;t try. The only way to bridge the gap
 sooner is to negotiate for more money or to look for a higher paying job in the
 same field.

&#xA0;

Arguing that women are less likely to
 negotiate shouldn&#x2019;t be the only factor to help the gender pay gap, but
 employers are doing everything they can to keep their money and employees need
 to be working harder to earn more money. This is a small, first step in the
 overall picture to help the gender pay gap.
