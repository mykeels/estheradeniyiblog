Let&#x2019;s get down to the nitty-gritty, shall we? The spiritual aspect of our lives that we do not want any other person to know about- quiet time. It&#x2019;s so quiet that it might be forever silent and out of our life schedules eventually. Are you struggling with maintaining a regular quiet time?

Well, &#xA0;I have been in this position several times. Communing with God isn&#x2019;t as automatic as a lot of people claim. We are pushed to believe that once we are born again, we should automatically connect with God and never falter in devotion. But this is not true. The hustle and struggle of living can cause a slow drifting. It&#x2019;s such a subtle and almost unnoticeable one.

Recently, I put a deep thought into how to make my quiet time constant despite the loads and loads of work on my neck. It can be difficult balancing the offline world with the online world, I tell you. There are some mornings I wake up and all I have on my brain is the blog design I am supposed to be turning in or one I am not speeding up. Sometimes, I am thinking of some more quality articles for my blog and before I know it, &#xA0;it&#x2019;s 2pm and still no quiet time. I admit that this can go on for as long as a week but the emptiness in my spirit doesn&#x2019;t go unnoticed.

Sometimes it&#x2019;s the dryness, other times it&#x2019;s the lack of boldness to approach God. The guilty feeling too. I want to quickly mention now that feelings as Christians aren&#x2019;t enough to judge the authenticity of our salvation. It&#x2019;s just a move of the devil to get us distant from God. Connection with God is by faith and not by feelings.

My failure in my place of constant communion has had ways of drowning me spiritually. Negligence and preoccupation with the cares of this world isn&#x2019;t anything to carelessly joke about. There must be an intentional check.

So, &#xA0;I made a list of what I should implement. Trials and errors are allowed in the place of communication with God. There are no hard and fast rules. If these do not work, I will move on to adjust until I am &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; in this regard.

-Have a constant time, mornings definitely.

-Make my quiet time interesting. Will incorporate some more music.

-Read lovelier and more interesting quiet time devotionals.

-Read my Bible before praying and not the other way round. I am switching things.

-Use the pidgin version of my eBible. It&#x2019;s deeper and closer to me.

Have you had or been having problems lately with your quiet time? What have you done? What are you planning to do? Let me know your thoughts in the comments section.
