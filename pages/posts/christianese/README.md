&#x201C;God bless you&#x201D;

&#x201C;It is well&#x201D;

&#x201C;You are blessed&#x201D;

And all of the other stuff is such a chore. Maybe Christianese is not a difficult language after all but it is beginning to feel as though there are so many versions of this and to be totally honest with you, I can&#x2019;t keep up with it anymore.

I do not have a single problem with &#x201C;God bless you&#x201D;. I mean, God bless me, really. Where my head is beginning to ache is when I am supposed to switch from the ordinary, plain, innocent English to Christianese.

Let me explain&#x2026;

I was going down the road after one of our powerful Sunday services to board a cab. Usually, no one ever goes that way after church. Oh, well, that is exactly why I do.

No crowd, less choke.

This dude, (I must warn you, he is part of the founding fathers of Christianese), spotted me and asked why I was going towards that direction. Innocent me just spewed;

&#x201C;Oh, I like to go down the road, it&#x2019;s way easier to find a cab&#x201D;

Just like he jolted from electrocution, he exclaimed:

&#x201C;You will never go down in Jesus&#x2019; name!!!&#x201D;

&#x2018;Here we go&#x2019;, I muttered under my breath.

What in the world, man.

From experience, stay away from these phrases if you ever have to be with anyone whose only language is Christianese.

&#x201C;What the hell&#x201D; (You must be joking!)

&#x201C;I am going down&#x201D; (Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah)

&#x201C;Are you the last person&#x201D; (Don&#x2019;t forget to add &#x2018;on the queue&#x2019; if you must say this)

&#x201C;Jesus Christ&#x201D; (Apparently, you are not supposed to call the name of the Lord in vain)

&#x201C;Shit&#x201D; (Just know you&#x2019;ll be ostracized from the circle. Don&#x2019;t try it)

&#x201C;Bullshit&#x201D; (Well, I just asked you not to say &#x201C;shit&#x201D;)

&#x201C;I am broke&#x201D;(Really, haven&#x2019;t you learned anything in church?&#x201D;

&#x201C;I am sick&#x201D; (You are speaking negative things into your life)

&#x201C;Is he crazy?&#x201D; (Say &#x201C;God bless him&#x201D; instead)

WTF (Dundee, what are you doing?)
