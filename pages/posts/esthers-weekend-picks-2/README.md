How are you doing this weekend? My sister, Joy, [turned 18 yesterday](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxDI_VLn6q2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and it seems to me as the positive highlight of the week after being put through a lot of stress by a bank I totally regret right now, Union Bank of Nigeria.

A lot of people have said that of all the banks to be with, Union Bank seems like a really poor choice and now I can&#x2019;t help but ask myself what I was thinking when I was walking in to sign up.

This weekend, I have a lot of really cool stuff to show you.

1. This &#x201C;how to [lose weight without dieting](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/ureport/article/2001323803/how-to-lose-weight-without-dieting-it-s-very-easy)&#x201D; article is kind of too easy but&#x2026; it could be it.

2. I wish I started bathing with [Lavender oil](https://estheradeniyi.com/essential-oils-training-in-lagos/) sooner.

3. What do you think about [Instagram hiding likes](https://globalnews.ca/news/5226438/instagram-hiding-likes-influencers-react/amp/)?

4. What @relationshipandmarriage had to say about [phone courtesy in relationships](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwm4H6GnelP/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1kncqg0k521yt) is one of the reasons some long distance relationships never survive. I speak from experience.

5.&#xA0; Someone needed to talk about this, [Jackie Hill Perry](https://www.instagram.com/jackiehillperry/) did.

6. Preston Perry [getting this out](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwqHuwYn6t3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) is daddy goals tho&#x2019;!

7. If this Wale Adenuga&#x2019;s Knockout doesn&#x2019;t crack you up, you are generally sad.

8. This [business casual](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-business-casual-guide-for-the-chic-woman/) look by Stella of [Jadore Fashion](http://www.jadore-fashion.com/2013/10/Asos-blue-full-skirt.html) is hot!

9.&#xA0; I bragged about this [reader&#x2019;s comment](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-15-point-checklist-to-start-a-blog-in-2019/) on Whatsapp status. Why not?

> &#x201C;*I&#x2019;ve been reading so much about (how to) starting my blog and after reading your article, I realize I should have read it first. Thanks for making it simple to understand. BTW, I found you on MIX aka stumble upon*&#x201C;

10. This [30 under 30](https://news.education.investing.com/top-30-under-30-up-and-coming-african-entrepreneurs/?utm_source=taboola&amp;utm_medium=cpm&amp;utm_campaign=NG-30Under3-MiniSite&amp;utm_term=standardgroupplc-standardmedia&amp;origin=taboola&amp;tp[click_id]=CjAzMWM1MDBhOS0zMmU4LTRkYjAtYjFiMS1lY2FmZDIzM2FhN2ItdHVjdDM5MTE5MzASEmludmVzdGluZy15dWtvbi1zYw&amp;tp[site_id]=1140481&amp;tp[site]=standardgroupplc-standardmedia&amp;tp[ts]=2019-05-04+17%3A01%3A55&amp;tp[campaign_id]=1841839&amp;tp[campaign_item_id]=170480804) list is so inspiring.
