Hey guys, I thought you&#x2019;d be excited at this, so I have
 decided to share with you. Lecrae will be visiting Nigeria for the first time on
 June 6, 2018 (#ATWT World Tour).[Download Only You Jesus by Ada](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/only-you-jesus-by-ada-lyrics-mp3)
For those of you that don&#x2019;t know Lecrae, he is one of the best Gospel
 Rappers in the world and he is going on a World Tour- &#xA0;&#x2018;All Things Work Together&#x2019;. This will be
 happening in Nigeria at Eko Convention Center.

Lecrae had revealed all of this on his Instagram handle,
 @Lecrae just recently and the whole world is bubbling with excitement.

I had first seen this on a friend&#x2019;s handle on Instagram and
 the comments that followed confirmed, Naija is going to light up man. People have
 already begun to express their excitement. I am excited too!
