I had once seen the plantain oatmeal recipe but I didn&#x2019;t think much of it until I had leftover ripe plantains from a house party. I wasn&#x2019;t ready to start frying so I decided I was going to make plantain [Quaker Oats](https://www.quakeroats.com/) recipe.

This year,&#xA0; we are making quick and healthy breakfasts. No time to waste time. The best part of this all is that oatmeal is such a healthy, filling food. Hey,&#xA0; weight watchers!

The fibre in Oats helps to aid your digestion and relieve constipation. Speaking of bowels and regular movement, oats is just the right kind of meal to add to your diet.

Also, oats contains Beta Glucan which helps lower your cholesterol? This is good news for people who are working hard to fight lifestyle diseases.

Now that we know that oats is kind of a big deal, let&#x2019;s get to the part where we whip it up into the simplest recipe ever!

You need only two ingredients : plantain and Quaker Oats.

Grate the ripe plantain with the smaller end of a manual grater or you can blend with a blender. I still like to see the plantain so I go for a coarse plantain batter.

Fill your pot with water, add in your oatmeal, let it boil for 3 minutes while you continuously stir. Add in your plantain batter and mix thoroughly. Put off heat after 7 minutes.

There you go, simple plantain&#xA0;Quaker Oats.&#xA0;&#xA0;You can eat with more raw plantains or add some milk if you want.

If you ever decide to try this, please holla. I really want to know what you think.
