## Lyrics to the (US) American National Anthem

&#xA0;

O! say can you see, by the dawn&#x2019;s early light,

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&#x2019;s last gleaming,

Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,

O&#x2019;er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?

And the rockets&#x2019; red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;

O! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

O&#x2019;er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

&#xA0;

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,

Where the foe&#x2019;s haughty host in dread silence reposes,

What is that which the breeze, o&#x2019;er the towering steep,

As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?

Now it catches the gleam of the morning&#x2019;s first beam,

In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:

&#x2018;Tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it wave

O&#x2019;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

&#xA0;

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore

That the havoc of war and the battle&#x2019;s confusion,

A home and a country, should leave us no more?

Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps&#x2019; pollution.

No refuge could save the hireling and slave

From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:

And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,

O&#x2019;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

&#xA0;

O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand

Between their loved homes and the war&#x2019;s desolation.

Blest with vict&#x2019;ry and peace, may the Heav&#x2019;n rescued land

Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!

Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,

And this be our motto: &#x2018;In God is our trust.&#x2019;

And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave

O&#x2019;er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

&#xA0;
