&#x201C;Awwwwwwwwwn, you have a gap tooth&#x201D;

&#x201C;Your smile is so beautiful, open your teeth more often&#x201D;

&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know you have a gap tooth&#x201D;

O ma wa ga o.

So I posted this picture on my Whatsapp status o. Come and see different types of comments ooooooo. I chatted all day and I was tayaaaaaad.

I don&#x2019;t like my gap tooth people, emi o like e atal. It appears to me like I have a missing tooth. In fact, my dentition is one of which I am not proud of. While some people are opening their teeth everywhere, you won&#x2019;t see me opening o. Hia!

In conclusion, my gap tooth makes me insecure.

What part of your body makes you insecure?
