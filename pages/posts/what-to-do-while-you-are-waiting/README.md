A while ago I was discussing with&#xA0;[Olubunmi Mabel](https://www.olubunmimabel.com) and I told her that I am not sure I am living my life to the fullest as a single woman.

I mean, I have so many gifts I have not even explored quite well. An example is my gift of singing. I also think that I have something in acting. I am not saying that I would be becoming a musician or actress or something. I just mean that I could do something with these things.

This is not to say that I cannot keep on exploring the talents and gifts the Lord has given to me even when I get married. It is just that it might be a little bit challenging given the responsibilities that might creep in, especially when a child is finally involved.

I want to bring alive my YouTube channel, there are some categories on my blog I haven&#x2019;t been able to bring to life yet due to some constraints. I am planning to take another postgraduate course in Communications or New Media. I want to travel. I want to learn how to do a certain number of things, the list would go on and on here if you allow me.

[Ife Grace](https://www.ifegrace.com) and I still discussed this yesterday. She thinks that many of the married people she knows have comfortably fallen into a routine. I agree with her because many of the married girls I know are in that too.

I have a number of things I want to do with my life and I am not even near many of them yet. This isn&#x2019;t only about singlehood and the waiting period before marriage. I want this article to be about the waiting period before anything at all.

What do you do before you have all the money you need to buy that land or all the outfits you need to launch your fashion store? What do you do while you wait for your 100 L first semester result or for the baby in your womb to come out?

Too many times we are consumed with the next phase, the next thing, the result, the goal, the final outcome and we in the process miss out on life.

We miss out on life, its essence, its beauty, nature, love, relationships, good food, interesting TV shows. We miss out on our hobbies, rest, true friendship, self-care, personal hygiene. This is all because we are totally consumed with that short-term, medium or long-term goal that isn&#x2019;t forthcoming yet.

If you ask me, I would suggest that you truly live while you wait. Focus on achieving that goal but live in the process. Don&#x2019;t sit around waiting for the man or woman to come, actively take part in your life.

I want you to read what Eniola posted on Instagram last week. I was at work when I stumbled on it and I paused to let it sink in. I read it over and over because nothing seemed truer as at the time. You should read it too.

> [I always looked forward to hanging out with my girls, they are amazing teenagers. While we often begin our get-togethers with laughs and gists about how they are each handling teenage transitions, conversations often time soon turned into complaints about stress at school, family and life. _ They know how much I love listening to each of them but I soon realized they were beginning to brood and forgetting to just live. During our last get together, I decided to teach them a little lesson that has helped me greatly in life. _ After giving them snacks, I went into the kitchen and returned with large cold juice bottles, and an assortment of cups; porcelain, plastic, glass, paper cups. Some of the cups were cheap, some plain looking, some expensive and some exquisite. I then told them to help themselves to the drinks. _ In few minutes most of them had a cup in their hands, while some were just staring at the left over cups. _ My lesson to them: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure you all noticed how fast all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is often the source of your problems and stress. _ &#x201C;What all of you really wanted was a cup of cold drink, not the cup, but you consciously went for the best cups and were eyeing each other&#x2019;s cups. _ &#x201C;Now I want you all to remember this: Life can be liken to the cold drinks, and the school, assignments, jobs, money and position in society are the cups. _ All of this are just accessories to hold and contain Life, they do not necessarily change the quality of Life. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the cold drinks God has provided for us. _ &#x201C;So, decide today to stop letting the cups drive you and just enjoy the cold drink (Life) God has placed before you. While you can strive endlessly to change the cups (School, job, car, houses, friends etc; you only have one cold drink (Life), so live it, love it and make maximum impact with it &#x201D; _ Good morning #Instafam. Arise, Shine and Live. Have the most amazing day. You truly have no limit. #EnnmaePen #MorningMusings #life #live #love #impact #inspire](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqemoDjnl5d/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading)

It&#x2019;s easy to fall into the cycle of sitting around while waiting for each stage to happen, or fretting while waiting for that goal to be accomplished but if we can practice coming back to living life everytime we fall in, we would have succeeded in recognizing anxiety and dumping it as soon as it creeps in.
