Nivea body lotions are gradually becoming everyone&#x2019;s favorites. This is because the standard Nivea body lotions live up to are unmatched.&#xA0;Each of the products in the Nivea lotion range is amazingly produced to meet needs and solve problems.

I was first introduced to Nivea lotion during my A-levels and it was the **Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion**. This is by far the most popular Nivea lotion in Nigeria and even though I was never the one to analyze body lotions and fragrances as at that time of my life, I loved it.

I really can&#x2019;t place why this popular blue Nivea lotion was the rave and is still is because it is intended to be deeply moisturizing from dry to very dry skin.

I must also mention that as at the time the range of Nivea body lotions were not skin care products I could afford. These are the kinds of products you bring from home. Your mother either bought them for you or you go to your dearly beloved original shea butter, coconut oil, pears or Vaseline.

In this blog post, I will be sharing the **best of the Nivea lotions you should try out in 2019.** I will try to cover as many grounds as possible. This is to aid your purchasing decision on which of the Nivea products to go for if you are a Nivea fanatic like me.

I mean, some of us don&#x2019;t even consider other body lotions. Whatever body lotion we are going for, it is going to be Nivea still, just with another name.

I have come to appreciate how carefully they produce their lotions. It is so glaring that Nivea as a skincare/cosmetic company releases products with consumers in mind and really, you want to be within that sect if you have a skin that means that much to you.

The fact that none of their body lotions is left stale is a relief. Nivea is always practically doing one thing or the other to update their products.

It is either a brand new packaging is released, ingredients are modified to meet up with current skin requirements or even entirely new products are rolled out to match up with the current needs of the consumers.

And you have no idea, Nivea is region eccentric. Like, they would go all out for market surveys to be sure this is what consumers in the regions need.

I remember the rolling out and the attendant popularity of **Nivea Natural Fairness**. That product was rolled out essentially for the African, particularly West African region.

There were a lot of frowns and all but I think that essentially understanding that the aim was not to induce or promote bleaching but to prevent further blackening and excessive tanning of the body was a good case to push.

I want to be sure to say that none of my Nivea lotion reviews as at the time of writing this is sponsored. I say this so that you can trust that I write with the interest of my blog readers at heart.

Of course, I don&#x2019;t mind sponsorship, what Blogger does anyway? Well, I would still say what I exactly think of any product or service even if it were sponsored. My criticisms are never destructive, however.

Any not so positive thought about a product or service is conveyed in the most gracious of manners to either express myself, inform the manufacturers, convey displeasing murmurs of other people or to press for a review of the product or service by the manufacturers.

## Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion
![Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Nivea-Essentially-Enriched-Body-Lotion-300x300.jpg)Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion
I mentioned this already. **Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion** seems to be the most popular Nivea lotion here in Nigeria. I would be glad to have a contrasting opinion in the comments section below though.

Given the harshness of our environment, I think a deeply moisturizing formula is a soothing relief. This Nivea lotion is supposed to be an intense moisturizing lotion for dry to very dry skin.

### Ingredients

Water, Mineral Oil, Isohexadecane, Glycerin, Petrolatum, PEG-40 Sorbitan Perisostearate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Magnesium Sulfate, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Potassium Sorbate

### Why you should try this

This Nivea lotion is exceptionally good for if you have dry skin. You want to have an intensive and deeply moisturizing lotion for your skin.

## Nivea Original Daily Moisture body lotion
![Nivea Original Daily Moisture body lotion](images\Nivea-Original-Daily-Moisture-body-lotion.jpg)Nivea Original Daily Moisture body lotion
This is the closest to the most popular Nivea body lotions in Nigeria. It comes in the customary blue colour like the first one. It only has a small portion of its top to be white. This is the major packaging difference.

Unlike Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion, it has Vitamin E replace Almond oil. If you have always wanted to have Vitamin E in your body care routine, this might be the best bet. You would not have to use Vitamin E separately again.

### Ingredients

Water, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lanolin Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, Carbomer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben

This Nivea lotion is exceptionally good for people who are allergic to strong scents. It has a mild smell so that you are not repulsed.

## Nivea shea daily moisture body lotion

Now, this product is the truth! You have no idea what you are dealing with when shea butter is involved. In fact, I [wrote a whole full post about shea butter](https://estheradeniyi.com/shea-butter/), its amazing benefits for hair and skin and every other thing you need to know about this amazing natural product.

Nivea shea daily moisture body lotion is that other excellent lotion for your dry skin. It leaves your body smooth and your skin deeply nourished. It is also quickly absorbed into your skin. Its deep moisture serum advantage is to die for.

### Ingredients

Water, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, C15-19 Alkane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin

### Why you should try it

## Nivea cocoa butter body lotion
![Nivea cocoa butter body lotion](images\Nivea-cocoa-butter-body-lotion.jpg)Nivea cocoa butter body lotion
This is currently my favorite, I don&#x2019;t know what will happen tomorrow but today Nivea cocoa butter is just awesome. The lovely cocoa butter scent of this Nivea lotion on its own is so relieving.

Trust me. There are other things you would like about this lotion but the smell is so good.

### Ingredients

Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Trisodium EDTA

If you are the aloe vera person, this is for you. This is a lightweight and fast absorbing formula and it is perfect for dry to normal skin. The scent is light and just natural. Some people have however reported that the scent is not the kind they would love.

I think this is a personal thing so you may want to beseech your seller to be kind enough to let you smell it. You only need to open the cap to smell. This is to help you not waste your money. Hopefully, it is the kind of smell you can stand.

### Ingredients

Water, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Dicaprylyl Ether, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin
