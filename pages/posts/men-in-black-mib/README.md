Yo, it&#x2019;s been a while I went to the cinema though. Whew! Such a hard worker&#xA0;I am, yeah? Hian&#x2026;

I have a checklist of movies I want to watch in 2019 as soon as they are out though.

I am not too sure I want to spend my money on cinema tickets this December and festive period. I want to keep my money to myself jare. Moreover, I am staying away from popcorn. Fitfam goals is always the perfect excuse for anything, try it.

**So, Men in Black!**

It is hilarious, there&#x2019;s a lot of action and I suspect some fast romance work.

Is **Men In Black** something you would like to watch?
