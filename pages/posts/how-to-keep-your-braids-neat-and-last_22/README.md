Hi guys (of course I&#x2019;m talking to &#x2019;em ladies). Trust you&#x2019;ve been good. How&#x2019;s the weather treating you?

Fair?
 Fine?
 Cool?

Anyway, it&#x2019;s been a mixed one here( I&#x2019;ll tell you how if you want to know sha).

OK, I know as a naturalista (as we the natural hair slayers are called), there&#x2019;s this great urge to rock and slay in braids but the thought of how long it will last without your tips poking out of the braid groove becomes a headache?, especially with the thought of the hike in attachment price?. **How do you keep your braids neat**?

Worry no more babe, I gat you, we will talk about how to keep braids neat. This is the easiest hack so far and it helped keep my braids intact for 6 weeks(mehn, I tried) and I had to take it out because I was tired of the hair and not for the fact that it was rough.

Back to the matter. After braiding and boiling the braid for a smooth feel, apply styling mousse in a generous quantity. Be very generous with it. (Personally, I prefer the Above styling mousse to Nova Gold. I stick with Nova Gold in the absence of Above. And it&#x2019;s the other way round with the oil sheen ?).

At night, you should tie the hair in a scarf (preferably satin). I know not everyone can be so diligent. But those are the two easy steps to keeping your braids neat. It is also how to [make your braids last longer](https://entertainment.naij.com/635433-5-ways-make-braids-last-longer.html).

So, braid that hair, and rock it weeelll.

Kilzez.
