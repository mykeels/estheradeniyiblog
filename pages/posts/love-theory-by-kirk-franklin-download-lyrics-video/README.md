## Love Theory By Kirk Franklin Lyrics

[Intro]
 Brothers and sisters
 I wanna welcome you back to life
 Back to the one that can make your next chapter
 Your best chapter
 Hallelujah

See: [This is a move by Tasha Cobbs](https://estheradeniyi.com/this-is-a-move-by-tasha-cobbs-leonard-lyrics-download-video/)

[Verse 1]
 How can it be that you love the most unlovable part of me, of me?
 How could you see your life was the only gift I&#x2019;ll ever need to be free?
 It&#x2019;s amazing with you, I win even if I lose
 Everything&#x2019;s working for my good for always

[Chorus]
 He saved the day
 He will come through
 He won&#x2019;t doubt, that&#x2019;s not what super heroes do
 No greater love makes my heart beat
 All I wanna do is make you proud of me

[Post-Chorus]
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody, love nobody but you

[Verse 2]
 How can it be, everyone of my secrets that you keep
 You cover me?
 A mystery, your patience with me, God, will never leave
 Don&#x2019;t ever leave

[Pre-Chorus]
 Help me to see like you
 No matter what I go through
 Everything&#x2019;s working for my good for always

[Chorus]
 He saved the day
 He will come through
 He won&#x2019;t doubt, that&#x2019;s not what super heroes do
 No greater love makes my heart beat
 All I wanna do is make you proud of me

[Post-Chorus]
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody, love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody, love nobody but you

[Bridge]
 Loving you will be, will be the death of me
 That&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s supposed to be
 More of you, less of me

[Pre-Chorus]
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody, love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody, love nobody but you

[Chorus]
 He saved the day
 He will come through
 He won&#x2019;t doubt, that&#x2019;s not what super heroes do
 No greater love makes my heart beat
 All I wanna do is make you proud of me
 He saved the day
 He will come through
 He won&#x2019;t doubt, that&#x2019;s not what super heroes do
 No greater love makes my heart beat
 All I wanna do is make you proud of me

[Outro]
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody, love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody but you
 I don&#x2019;t wanna love nobody, love nobody but you
