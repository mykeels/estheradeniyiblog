**Taraji P. Henson** brought it down. It rained some fire and brimstone. **What Men Want** is a fantasy/comedy-drama with a lot of juice and sauce. There were some little jabs at racism issues, lesson nuggets about workplace politics, take home on love and respect and a very good dose of hot romance.

I totally enjoyed it and I am giving it an 8/10. The rest of the 2 for making me lose my home training laughing like a local girl.

**What Men Want** was first class comedy wrapped in a box of good acting. The scenes were smoothly transitioned into the story, so sweet.

Unlike so many of the other times, I went to the box office prepared for What Men Want. I had posted about it on my Instagram and 10/10 of people who commented absolutely loved it so why not?

Or you should watch the movie trailer in case you have been in a hole the whole time.
