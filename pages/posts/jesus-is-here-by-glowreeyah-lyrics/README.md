 Oh I know that Jesus is here.

 (Worship Interlude)

 The King who loves me forever is here

 The King of goodness and mercy is here

 The King of healing and power is here

 Let every power surrender

 He&#x2019;s here.

[Lyrics of Olowogbogboro by Nathaniel Bassey](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/lyrics-of-olowogbogboro)

 I can see His power, power, power working in me
 I know that Jesus is here.
 I can see His power, power, power working in me
 I know that Jesus is here.
 Oh, I know that Jesus is here(Repeat 4x)

 I can see His power, power, power working in me
 I know that Jesus is here.

 I can see His power, power, power working in me
 I know that Jesus is here

 We call you Kabiyesi o
 Hosanna o
 I know that Jesus is here

 Akpo&#x2019;m gi Eze, Eze, Eze mo
 I know that Jesus is here

 Ojo Chamachalla mi, Chamachalla mi, Chamachalla mi o
 I know that Jesus is here

 Your name is Yahweh(2x)
 I know that Jesus is here
 You are the Miracle-Working God
 Your name is Yahweh (2x)
 I know that Jesus is here

 I can see His power, power, power working in me

 I know that Jesus is here.

 Have you listened to Jesus is Here? What do you think? Well, it lifted my spirit. I liked the melody and lyrics. I still can&#x2019;t figure out what the Igbo words mean tho&#x2019;. If you can, please let me know.
