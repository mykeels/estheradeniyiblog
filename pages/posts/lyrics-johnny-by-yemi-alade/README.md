Did you enjoy the lyrics to Johnny by Yemi Alade? Let me know in the comments section.&#xA0;

The first time I heard of Johnny by Yemi Alade, I was going through Bella Naija and I saw that the Johnny video had hit millions. Someone somewhere had also said that Johnny by Yemi Alade was the most popular music video by an African American woman on YouTube. Of course, this spiked my curiosity and I was off to check.&#xA0;

True, this music was released long ago but I could find why people developed a liking for it. The African culture portrayed in the Johnny video was with exotic style. Not only that, it was raw and very expressive.&#xA0;

To also think that some girls would relate to the ish Johnny had caused his lover was another thing. I think Johnny is a good work of art with a nice blend of melody and story.
