Not too many people are familiar with the unique Touch Me Not Plant. Its proper name is Mimosa Pudica. The seemingly shy plant has earned a range of nicknames around the planet, including the bashful plant, shrinking plant, sleepy plant, and shy plant. When you touch the plant&#x2019;s leaves, they shrink or fold inwards in what is known as a rapid plant movement. This allows them to protect their leaves from animals who are grazing. Minutes later, the leaves reopen.

**Most people have no idea at all that this Touch Me Not Plant offers an incredible array of healing properties for many different ailments. We look at some of the more useful ones in this article.**
