It&#x2019;s one thing to love the prospects of a new career terrain, it&#x2019;s another, to quickly find your way around and figure out how to climb faster. It can be a struggle if it&#x2019;s a new terrain overall. You are probably just learning how to crawl, yet, you have to make something great out of it at the same time.

The pressure is not only external. You are going to deal with the internal pressure too. You might feel not qualified enough, not good enough. Sometimes, you want to even take bigger strides and you feel like a fraud.

I get it, we&#x2019;ve all been there. I mean, I have had to move slowly when I had to capacity to move faster just because I was new and didn&#x2019;t want to trigger unnecessary questioning.

In fact, some people look down on you because you are young in the field. They probably think that you do not have what it takes to handle the big things. Sometimes, your professional advice is thrown into the bin just because you do not have enough work experience to voice an opinion.

How can you be taken seriously? What can you do to move from where you are right now to the point where they can take your word for it, they can trust your professional judgement, they can allow you call the shots?

I have a few suggestions that I am sure will very much help.

**Please pin this&#xA0;**

![How to be taken seriously](images\20190624_130226_0000.png)

*1. You are fit*

If you were hired, you are fit for the job! You need to deal, first of all with the internal struggles of second-guessing yourself. If this is out of the way, if you find your confidence, you are close to finding your footing.

Maybe you need to remind yourself &#x2013; I am qualified, my input matters. Your opinions and weight are important. Without you, there&#x2019;s one less person to make things work.

*2. Look the part*

You probably never thought this mattered but it matters so much more than you can ever imagine. Listen, the way you put together your outfit will go a very long way to not only boosting your self confidence but getting people to trust you.

I know a lot of people believe that what matters the most is what they have upstairs ; in their heads. I wish it were so but while this matters, you appearance is your first foot forward.

If you work in an office that&#x2019;s strictly official, dress as that and be your best. If it&#x2019;s a business casual kind of setting, do not go sloppy or tilt too much towards the casual. If you are having challenges combining outfits for your business casual workplace, [this guide](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-business-casual-guide-for-the-chic-woman/) is just perfect!

*3. Be so good they cannot ignore you!*

One thing you should know is that if you are to be taken seriously, you need to look for opportunities to prove yourself. This may sound a little bit awkward but I put this to you now, find how to prove yourself.

Maybe you are starting out as an intern, be ready to learn, explore and then expand. After then, become the best they have ever seen. No one will just push the crown to you if they are not absolutely sure it fits your head.

You can&#x2019;t blame your boss especially when revenue is involved and the company&#x2019;s reputation is at stake. They need the best, be the best. Be so good they are afraid to lose you. You know how to do it, trust me.

As you read this, you have ideas and thoughts in your mind already. You know what to do, you know how to get there so just do it. Don&#x2019;t play hanky panky, simply get to work. Deliver the best, deliver on time. Innovate faster and better processes. Let smooth ideas be attached to your name. Infiltrate the system with integrity.

*4. Be assertive*

Of course, in the most respectful manner. Voice out your submissions with surety. A lot of newbies speak in low tones. It says a lot about your self confidence. Speak up and speak well.

Being assertive also goes beyond speaking. It also has to do with your physical presence. Have a firm handshake, maintain eye contact. Nod when you agree, actively listen, communicate verbally and clearly. If you didn&#x2019;t beg for the job, do it with boldness.

*5. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to fail*

One of the reasons you may feel like you are short of what you are is when you assume that you are supposed to be perfect. The fear of failing will keep you from expressing and that will relegate you to the back.

The pros fail. In fact, they fail a lot. It&#x2019;s just that they fail fast, move back up fast. So, take the plunge.

*6. Understand and use boundaries*

When you become familiar with your new career/job/colleagues, understand and use boundaries well. If you are going to be taken seriously, you don&#x2019;t want to be the guy that&#x2019;s never serious, the office clown.

Know when it&#x2019;s work and when it&#x2019;s play. I have personally worked with people I am not confident in. I can&#x2019;t say for sure what they mean. I can&#x2019;t validate their opinions. In fact, I can&#x2019;t vouch for them. What if they were joking? What if they didn&#x2019;t mean it?

Don&#x2019;t be that guy. Speak when it&#x2019;s necessary and collaborate meaningfully. That you are new is not an excuse to be constantly silly. Square up! When it&#x2019;s time to loosen up, by all means.

If you are willing and ready to take to all of this, you are going to be just fine, trust me. Don&#x2019;t go out of your way to show that you should be taken seriously, that&#x2019;s like being too aggressive and it turns people off. Make silent strides. Work quietly and intentionally, then let your results show.

Please don&#x2019;t forget to share this on Pinterest
