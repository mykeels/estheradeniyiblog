![Linda Ikeji and her sister, Laura Ikeji](images\Linda-Ikeji-and-her-sister-Laura-Ikeji.png)

Also, she had a soft spot for News reporting and interviews and she was very interested in them as a child. Her family wasn&#x2019;t too funded with money and they experienced lots of financial instability like many other Nigerian families can testify to.

She applied for Mass Communication at the University of Lagos when it was time to attend the tertiary institution. She applied to the University of Lagos but unfortunately for her, she wasn&#x2019;t admitted for the course she wanted but was rather admitted to study the English Language.

It was due to her enthusiasm for News reporting and broadcasting, that she was inspired to choose Mass Communication as a preferred course to study at the University. But obviously, destiny had it planned for Linda Ikeji in a totally different way&#x2026; Entirely&#x2026;

## Linda Ikeji&#x2019;s Blogging Journey

![Linda Ikeji pictures 3](images\Linda-Ikeji-pictures-3.jpg)

She really did well as a model. She had all it took a lady to be a top-notch model in Nigeria. She had the confidence, the classiness, the fashion sense and the beauty required to excel as a model in Nigeria.

At the time, modeling wasn&#x2019;t too well paying in Nigeria But Linda Ikeji did it to feed herself through School and refused to engage in prostitution like many of her friends did Because she felt it took her dignity away.

At the time, she didn&#x2019;t have any idea that she was going to be a well renowned Blogger in Nigeria yet. When she completed her University education she set up a modeling agency which she named Black Dove Communications. This name Black Dove was inspired by the name of the media company and brand in Nigeria popularly called Silver Bird.

![Linda Ikeji pictures](images\Linda-Ikeji-pictures.png)

This modeling agency thing and company that she set up wasn&#x2019;t well-paying either. So, she started blogging for fun two years after graduation from the University. She is famously known for saying that, she did not go into blogging with the expectation to make money.

She said that she didn&#x2019;t even think that she could make money from it at all but when she started getting a significant amount of views to her blog, for example, up to like 200 views in a day, she decided to take things seriously.

And she did take her blogging career seriously as it has now paid off very well for her. She was making a lot of money already with her blog that was even still a subdomain at the time!

As at that time in 2006, blogging was a totally new concept in Nigeria. Very few people blogged and so when she started her news blogging platform, people were really glad to find a place on the Internet where they could get hot news, steaming news in Nigeria as it dropped!

It was in 2007 that her blog started to know fame, a year after its inception. Now her blog is a name to reckon with in the Nigerian society and indeed in Africa.

She preaches celibacy until marriage for both men and women. Although she has come under fire recently since she got pregnant this year 2018 and has been delivered of a baby boy.

Lots of people criticized her because she wasn&#x2019;t already married before she got pregnant. Lots of people also accused her of being a hypocrite and going against what she had previously preached.

![Linda Ikeji&apos;s pregnancy](images\Linda-Ikejis-pregnancy.png)

But she has come out to clear the air about her celibacy and pregnancy. She said that when she clocked 36 years of age she did not think it was smart to continue with the celibacy stance since one of the best gifts she could ever have, was her own child.

She said she prayed to God about her wanting a child and God indeed came to her rescue. Around the middle of September 2018, she came clean on the name of the father of her son who goes by the name, Sholaye Jeremi. She named her son, Jayce Jeremi.

The billionaire first-time mum, Linda Ikeji shared a lot of her pregnancy journey online with her fans for them to follow and has obviously been blessed with the gift that she has always been asking God for, which is a child.

Sholaye Jeremi who is Linda Ikeji&#x2019;s Baby-daddy is of the Itsekiri tribe. Linda Ikeji once described him as a tall, dark and handsome man and just left it at that to keep her fans guessing at who her Baby-daddy was.

Sholaye Jeremi is from Delta state Nigeria and is of the Itsekiri tribe as stated earlier. He is into the oil industry and is a billionaire oil magnate who lives in Lagos state, Nigeria and the exact location is actually Ikoyi where Linda Ikeji herself lives too.

Sholaye Jeremi is also associated with Nigeria&#x2019;s current Minister of State for petroleum, Mr Ibe Kachikwu; this is just to show how influential he is. Rumours have been around too though that Linda&#x2019;s Baby-daddy, Sholaye Jeremi might have a family outside of Nigeria and that Jaycee Jeremi, Linda&#x2019;s son might not be his first child.
