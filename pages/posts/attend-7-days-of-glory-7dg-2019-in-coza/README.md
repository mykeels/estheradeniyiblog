**COZA&#x2019;s 7 Days of Glory** is here again and I am so so excited. Shortly after I began attending COZA, 7 Days of Glory 2018 kicked off. There was so much excitement and I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to understand why.

What? Is it like a worship jamboree or something? I just wanted to know what the fuss was about. Apparently, I had to experience 7 days of glory to understand what the fuss was about. Now, I am making a fuss lol.

7 Days of Glory 2018 was an extremely beautiful time for me with God. This is why I am overly excited about this year. Don&#x2019;t worry, I got all the deets for you.

The idea behind COZA&#x2019;s 7 Days of Glory is that you have an avenue to recharge and refuel during the mid-year. It is a time to fast, pray and worship.

12 Days of Glory is usually at the beginning of the year to start off on the right foot.

**Date**: July 1st (Monday) &#x2013; July 7th (Sunday)
**Time**: Monday &#x2013; Saturday by 6 pm. On Sunday, 9 am
**Venue**: The Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Gilmor Construction Area, Guzape, Asokoro Extension, Abuja Nigeria.
