Speaking of glamour and bling, well you have it. The **Bling Lagosians movie** was a stark representation of the excesses of extremely rich Lagosians. This movie made me remember Crazy Rich Asians. Women with long eyelashes and glittery dresses.

Directed by **Bolanle Austen-Peters**, The Bling Lagosians did not fall short at portraying the consequences of being filthy rich in Lagos, or at all. The unending gossips, lavish spending, jealousy, betrayal, revenge and secrets, all duly featured in the lives of the different characters.
