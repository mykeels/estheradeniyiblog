That topic above is inspired by a quote I found on Pinterest
 which is by Albert Einstein. The quote says;

&#x201C;Everybody is
 a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live
 its whole life believing that it is stupid.&#x201D; ~ Albert Einstein

Deep quote right? Yeah. I find Pinterest very informative
 and useful in [finding quotes](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/top-25-best-women-quotes-to-inspire-you) and ideas. It is a very fantastic application,
 very very valuable. You should try it out.

So! Everybody is a genius. That statement&#x2026;

Well, it is so true and correct. [Everybody is a genius intheir own way](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/06/fish-climb/). In their own special way. And what is that way? Talent. We hear &#x201C;Find your talent! Know what you&#x2019;re good
 at!&#x201D; Well, no matter how clich&#xE9; those statements sound, they are so right.
 I decided to look up the word &#x201C;Talent&#x201D; in my phone&#x2019;s English
 dictionary and here&#x2019;s what I found;

Talent: A marked natural ability or skill. And then they put an example; &#x201C;The man has a talent of touching his nose with his
 tongue.&#x201D;

Individual talent is what makes everyone a genius. Albert
 said a fish would think itself stupid if you or itself judged it by its ability
 to climb a tree. Yes! It&#x2019;s true! We all know a fish&#x2019;s natural skill or
 talent is not in climbing a tree but in swimming. Their natural habitat isn&#x2019;t
 even on land but in water. So what makes a fish fascinating to a human? Its
 uncommon ability to swim and live under water. Humans don&#x2019;t have this.

So, [life is about finding what you&#x2019;re good at](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/shannon-kaiser/3-unexpected-ways-to-find_b_5176511.html) and making the
 most use of it to serve humanity or even the universe at large. Comedians,
 actors, writers, public speakers, musicians and a whole lot more all hone into
 their skills to thrill people and also make a living. If they are not talented
 in that area, you&#x2019;ll see they&#x2019;ll quickly die out or people won&#x2019;t really
 appreciate them. So, the key is find what you&#x2019;re genius at. Look for it&#x2026; It&#x2019;s
 there. There is nobody born without a natural talent. We all have purpose we&#x2019;ve
 come to fulfill in life. Talents are usually in line with that purpose. Your
 talent is what makes you a genius. It&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ll sell to people and people
 would wholeheartedly embrace and buy. Because the way you do that thing you do
 is so amazing. People are willing to pay for it. That is Talent.

But some of us still struggle in finding our unique call.
 What&#x2019;s that special thing I am good at? What&#x2019;s my unique purpose? What natural
 ability did God put in me to use to serve humanity? That&#x2019;s one question I have
 always asked myself as well. And believe me, I am still on my path to finding
 it. You&#x2019;re reading this because it&#x2019;s part of my purpose or purposes on earth.
 To inspire you, counsel you to find your unique call. Probably my purpose is to
 counsel&#x2026; Maybe. We&#x2019;ll see..

So, I decided to do a little bit of research and I came up
 with five bullet points on how you can know that unique call. I am no expert
 but research allows one to&#xA0;gather
 information even experts can&#x2019;t gather. Because even experts don&#x2019;t know it all..
 And guess what? Bring your ear&#x2026; I love to research!&#x2026;

So below are five things to do to know that unique purpose, to know your talent;

1. Think about your hobbies. What is it about those hobbies
 that makes you love them so? What do they center around?

I love reading articles that enlighten me wherever
 I can find them. I love to read [self help articles](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/search/label/Life) and books especially in
 areas I know little about. It turns out that I also have a talent in writing.
 So my hobbies are due to an inner urge to help people out, to inspire through
 writing. Although I am still discovering, uncovering my inner self.

2. Search Yourself. Think.. Dig. Seek your talent and you
 will find it.

3. Try new things that intrigue you. You never can tell,
 your talent might be there. If you try one and you haven&#x2019;t found still, pick
 another one. Don&#x2019;t give up searching. It&#x2019;s the ultimate search.

4. What makes you forget to eat? What keeps you awake at
 3am? What are you willing to withstand hardships that you wouldn&#x2019;t allow
 normally? In there may lie your talent. Probe yourself. I probed. And I am
 still discovering.

5. Ask your loved ones what they think is your unique
 talent. Or if you have the money find a life or career coach or Psychologist.
 Ask basically.

So, maybe in those questions you were able to discover it,
 then high five! But if you&#x2019;re still searching, please keep looking. Persistence
 and perseverance are keys. Please unlock your talent with them. Be patient
 okay? You&#x2019;ll find it. Just don&#x2019;t give up probing.

So, now you see everyone is really a genius right? It all
 lies in finding your own genius Sweetie. Nobody is talentless. Dig deep and
 you&#x2019;ll find yours.

Yours Love,
