Dear Diary,

I just want
 what every woman wants
Warm arms
 on a cold night
Promises of
 forever
And
 wonderful todays
Silent
 understanding&#xA0;
And kisses
 that leave me breathless&#x2026;.

I want what
[every woman wants](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/what-every-woman-wants-her-man-to-know)
Soft words
 in hard times
Someone to
 read my heart
And touch
 my mind&#x2026;
I want a
 co-conspirator
A treasure
 chest to hold my secrets

I want a
 firm hold
When I am
 losing my grip&#x2026;
Someone to
 call me in from the rain&#x2026;
To be my
 shield
My pillow
 my river
My mountain
 my rock&#x2026;

I want a
 raven to feed me in the wilderness&#x2026;
I want to
 be rescued&#xA0;
Lost in an
 embrace and found not wanting&#x2026;

What do I
 want?
What every
 woman wants&#x2026;
To find her
 way home&#x2026;
