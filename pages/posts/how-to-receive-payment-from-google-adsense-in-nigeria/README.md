**So, How Do You Receive Google Adsense Payment In Nigeria**

First things first, you must have crossed the payment threshold to even consider receiving your earnings from Google AdSense. This is $100.

As soon as you are 100 Dollars gone, you are eligible to get your first earning. This also applies subsequently to other months. You have to have at least $100 in your Google AdSense account to be paid.

If your earnings don&#x2019;t accrue to a 100 Dollars after the month you wish to be paid, you don&#x2019;t have to worry, it will be kept and accrued until you get to the payment threshold.

There are two major ways to receive Google AdSense payment here in Nigeria.

The first method is the **Bank wire transfer method** which is by far the easiest and most straight forward.

**How do you&#xA0;receive Google AdSense payment through wire transfer?**

This is done directly and automatically to your bank account in Naira here in Nigeria. Gone are the days when you had to have a dormicillary account to be eligible to get your Google Adsense payments.

What you need to do is to set up your form of payment in the payment settings. Log in to your Google AdSense account and go to the settings page. Click on payment and go to payments settings.

Then click to **add a new form of payment**. Select the wire transfer to bank account and fill as appropriate

**Beneficiary Id**: This is optional. You don&#x2019;t need to fill that. You can leave that space empty.

**Name on bank account**: Fill in your full name as it appears on your bank account

**Bank name** : This is the name of your bank

**SWIFT BIC** : you have to contact your bank&#x2019;s customer care for this. If you are using GTBank, your SWIFT BIC is GTBINGLA

**Account number** : You type in your account number here

**Re-type Account number** : simply retype your account number.

All the other fields like: Intermediary bank, Intermediary bank name, Intermediary SWIFT-BIC, FFC or FBO, leave blank.

You don&#x2019;t need to fill them as you are a Nigerian planning to recieve Google payments here in Nigeria.

When you are done, you tick the box beside &#x201C;Set as primary payment method&#x201D;

The second option is receiving through check. Because of the system we have here in Nigeria, this doesn&#x2019;t seem to me as a wise, easy option. I will however still share with you the procedure of how to receive Google AdSense payment in Nigeria through check.

**How to receive your AdSense payments by check**

To receive your payments through check, you have to do so through DHL. You may need to pay DHL some fees at the end of the day.

You will first of all need to set up your check payment gateaway and make it your primary method. Here is how to do it, very easy.

Go to payment settings as usual, click on &#x201C;Add a payment method&#x201D; and then &#x201C;Add new Check details&#x201D; afterward.

You then enter the address you would like the check to be mailed to, your name, city, postal code, state and other necessary details on the form.

Then, set that option as the primary payment method. Payments through check are sometimes delayed because of the logistics involved. This is Nigeria, remember?

**How money is deposited into your bank account by Google AdSense**

If your earnings have accrued before you got your **Google AdSense PIN**, as soon as you get it and verify, Google AdSense will send your accrued earnings, greater than $100 of course, to your bank.

In less than 24 hours of verifying your PIN, you should get an email from Google Payment with the title &#x2013; &#x201C;**Google AdSense &#x2013; Check Your Recent Payment**&#x201D;

Technically, the money is sent into your bank account. You will have to wait to receive it. If you don&#x2019;t receive it within 5 working days, you have to contact your bank to complain.

Subsequently, or if you didn&#x2019;t have $100 before verification, you will have to wait for monthly deposits. On the 21st of every month, you have this process automatically happen.

Very easy.

**Downsides of receiving Google AdSense Payment into your savings Naira account**

With a domiciliary account, you receive your Google AdSense Payment in dollars. This will give you the chance to change from Dollars to Naira at a very reasonable price.

You may have to contact an aboki or any other money exchanger to sell the Dollars. If you have a constant aboki person, good. If not, that&#x2019;s another quest.

Any which way, the deposit into your bank account is even though seemless comes at a much reduced priced. For example, as of now, rates are 1 dollar to 300-310 Naira. If you do a dollar exchange, you should have 1 dollar go for 350-361 Naira.

Have you ever been paid your Google AdSense earnings? How did you receive them? By bank wire transfer or by check?
