Last week, Michael &#x2018;dm&#x2019;ed me and asked that I talk about his song. It was supposed to be a sponsored post but by the time I downloaded and listened to the song,&#xA0; I was blown away.

This song has been on my mind, head and lips all week and for something worthwhile, I would like to share it with you.

### More than Enough lyrics

Chorus

 You&#x2019;re everything and more than enough

You&#x2019;re everything and more than enough

Jesus Christ the sacrifice you paid

It&#x2019;s everything, it&#x2019;s more than enough

It&#x2019;s everything, it&#x2019;s more than enough

Verse 1

You are creator of the universe

Father the One who knows everything

Healer mender of the broken hearts

You are more than Enough

You&#x2019;re the way the truth and Life

Everything I&#x2019;ll ever ever need

They are truly found in you

You have being and you would always be

Chorus again

Verse 2

You are the living water

Fountain springing up eternal life

Your awesome presence lives in me

Great and marvellous One

You&#x2019;re the way the truth and Life

Everything I&#x2019;ll ever ever need

They are truly found in you

You have being and you would always be

Chorus again

Bridge

I maybe pressed on every side

I&#x2019;ll still trust in You

No matter what comes my way

I&#x2019;ll still sing for joy

Chorus again
