## Lyrics of Ekwueme by Prospa Ochimana

Onye Nwe anyi ezitewo***&#xA0;(Our God who sent)***
 Ndi Mmoziya ka ha nonyere anyi
***(His angels to come be minister to us)***
 You are the Living God O!
 Eze&#xA0;***(King)***, no one like You

[Prospa Ochimana also sang : The Great I am. Check out for download and lyrics](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-great-i-am-by-prospa-ochimana/)

Ekwueme! Ekwueme!&#xA0;***(The One who says and does)***
 Ekwueme! Ekwueme!&#xA0;***(The One who says and does)***
 You are the living God o!
 Eze&#xA0;***(King)***, no one like you&#xA0;*(Repeat)*

You&#x2019;re my Healer, You are my Keeper
 My Restorer, My Life-giver
 You are the living God o!
 Eze&#xA0;***(King)***, no one like You

No one can do me like You do
 No one can touch me like You do, God!
 You are the living God o!
 Eze&#xA0;***(King)***, no one like You

You picked me from the miry clay; set my feet on the rock to stay
 You are my Promoter; You are my Defender
 You are the Living God o!
 Eze&#xA0;***(King)***, no one like you
