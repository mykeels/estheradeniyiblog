**Onise Iyanu**

You are the God of awesome wonders

I&#x2019;ve tasted of your power

Onise Iyanu

You have shown me so much mercy

Much more than I deserve

&#xA0;

[Olowogbogboro by Nathaniel Bassey](https://estheradeniyi.com/lyrics-of-olowogbogboro/)

&#xA0;

My eyes have seen, my ears have heard

The wonders of your praise

Creation bows in awe of you

And we join to give you praise

&#xA0;

The words you speak turns things around

Your outstretched arm

Has lifted me

You took away the chains and colts

That held me bound

&#xA0;

Onise Iyanu

You are the God of awesome wonders

I&#x2019;ve tasted of your power

Onise Iyanu

You have shown me so much mercy

Much more than I deserve

&#xA0;

Omniscient, Omnipotent

the one who does great things

when I behold the things you do

I just can&#x2019;t hold back my praise

&#xA0;

[Alagbada Ina by Nathaniel Bassey](https://estheradeniyi.com/alagbada-ina-by-nathaniel-bassey-lyrics/)

&#xA0;

The words you speak turns things around

Your outstretched arm

Has lifted me

You took away the chains and colts

That held me bound

&#xA0;

Onise Iyanu

You are the God of awesome wonders

I&#x2019;ve tasted of your power

Onise Iyanu

You have shown me so much mercy

Much more than I deserve

&#xA0;

Onise Iyanu

You are the God of awesome wonders

I&#x2019;ve tasted of your power

Onise Iyanu

You have shown me so much mercy

Much more than I deserve
