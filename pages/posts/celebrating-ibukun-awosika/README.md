 magnate, an author and a motivational speaker. She is one of the [leading women](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/happy-international-womens-day)
 in Nigeria business-wise.

Today we celebrate a gem, a woman who has defied all odds to
 become who she is today and in fact, respected among men. More often than not, some
 positions and class are seen as only for men. However, the current trend of
[gender equality](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/because-we-are-good-women-we-will) has paved way for few people, one of which she is.

&#x201C;[Seeing my drive as a young entrepreneur](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/dear-entrepreneur-know-these-50-things), my father used to
 say , &#x2018;I have given birth to this one&#x2019;, and if anything happened , he was
 always present to assist me even if it means selling his house to pay up any
 debts I may have incurred along the way. He never discouraged me.&#x201D;

As an advice to [business](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/15-essential-appstools-for-small) owners, she said; &#x201C;You must
 understand that you are not indispensable to your business because you are not
 God. You are not the most important person in your business, the guys who work
 for you are just as important as well. You must learn to respect them and the
 value they bring into your business. You can&#x2019;t pay them peanuts and pay
 yourself all the money.&#x201D;
