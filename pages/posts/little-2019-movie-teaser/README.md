If you hate your boss, the opening scenes of **Little** are just about the most therapeutic session you will ever attend, ever!

Little is a 1 hour 49-minute long fantasy/comedy movie that weaves in the reality of working with people who had dramatically faulty childhood experiences. These ones grow up to become world-class terror!

**Jordan (Regina Hall)** is the mean boss no assistant ever dreams of working with. Her employees are daily tormented by her incessant bullying and overboard rude talks during meetings. Things take a drastic turn around when she transforms into her younger self. She soon realizes that the faster she gets on to being reasonable, the better for her.

## Conclusion

Little might not be the movie you want to watch in the cinema. I think that the story is weak. The acting is however top-notch and perfect. Speaking of funny, you will surely catch yourself laughing all over the place many times.

Have you seen Little yet? What do you think?
