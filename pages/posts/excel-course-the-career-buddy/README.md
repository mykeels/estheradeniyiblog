If you think you know Excel as much as you should, this Excel course will most definitely change your mind. There is a whole lot more to Excel as a software than what you see and how much of its application you can deploy is what will differentiate you from an ordinary Excel application user.

This time you are using Excel for more advanced purposes and this includes in-depth data analysis and interpretation.

According to the World Economic Forum jobs report, Data Analysis and Analytical Reasoning is the 3rd most in-demand skill in the job market for employers in 2019.

If inputting data is all anyone needs to stand out, we have all probably passed that test. There is a much bigger picture here. You want to be able to analyze and interpret data quickly. The most interesting part of this all is that it doesn&#x2019;t matter where you work, data is constantly being used and analyzed. Decisions are being made based on inference from this data.
