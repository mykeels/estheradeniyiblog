 It is not surprising that a lot of people are desperately looking for the **best body cream for fair skin in Nigeria**. Fair skin, I must say is so very difficult to manage in Nigeria.

The weather is so harsh and unfair to even dark and chocolate coloured people. It is worse for people who are fair in complexion. They have to carefully select the **best cream for their fair complexions**.

I know this because my mum and one of my sisters are fair. My dad and the rest of us are not fair complexioned. Even though my mum isn&#x2019;t really particular about body creams for fair complexioned people, my sister is.

It&#x2019;s always a feat to find suitable products for yourself. Whether you&#x2019;re fair or dark-complexioned, a [**corresponding face lotion**](https://www.productexpert.com/best-face-lotions-for-women/)&#xA0;is important. It helps keep your skin rejuvenated and young for longer

**Below is a list of the best body creams that can be considered when picking one for your fair complexion skin.**

In all, while picking, you want to watch out for creams that have very good moisturizing effects and do not have side effects on your skin like bleaching or making it darker on interaction with the sun.

## Fair and White Gold Revitalizing Body Lotion

![Fair and White Gold Revitalizing Body Lotion](images\Fair-and-White-Gold-Revitalizing-Body-Lotion.jpg)

One of the things to look out for in the cream to pick for your fair skin, apart from the moisturizing effect is the presence or absence of hydroquinone. **Fair and White Gold Revitalizing Body Lotion** does not contain hydroquinone which is such a good thing for people who want to brighten their colour and not have side effects.

The exfoliating lotion is also really good for gentle exfoliation especially if you don&#x2019;t use a body scrub. Fair and White Gold Skin Care is a skin care line with a lot of other good skin care products for fair skinned people.

This rich lotion helps to diminish the appearance of dark spots on your knees, elbows, knuckles, and feet.

There are apparently many types of Fair and White body lotions and from online reviews, they all seem to be okay. You can just watch out for the particular product with this description.

**Fair & White 1: F&W Gold AHA Brightening Lotion**&#xA0;also seems to be a very good alternative if you are going for a very good cream for your fair skin.

## Nivea Natural Fairness

![Nivea Natural Fairness](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nivea-Natural-Fairness-257x300.png)

Now, **Nivea Natural Fairness** isn&#x2019;t just that really perfect body cream for fair skinned people but for all colours. I personally use this and since I started using it, even as a dark/chocolate skinned person, I have experienced a gentle brightening of my skin.

[I have a very thorough and in-depth review of Nivea Natural Fairness here](https://estheradeniyi.com/nivea-natural-fairness-review-2/).

## Dove Pro-Age Body Cream

![Dove Pro-Age Body Cream](images\Dove-Pro-Age-Body-Cream.jpg)

Now, all of Dove&#x2019;s product comes with a lot of thought. I say this because of the Dove Beauty Bar I have stuck to. This by far, has been the best soap for me because it is deeply moisturizing. [I have a review of Dove Beauty Bar here.](https://estheradeniyi.com/my-dove-beauty-bar-review/)

So, **Dove Pro-Age Body Cream**. This body cream is very good for people that are fair. It also doubles as a good anti-aging cream with all of its really cool ingredients.

### Dove Pro-Age Body Cream Ingredients

## Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 15

![Aveeno moisturizing cream with SPF 15](images\aveeno-daily-moisturizing-lotion-spf-15-12-oz.jpg)

Aveeno lotion with SPF 15 is that one body cream for fair people living in Nigeria. The sunscreen is one of its selling points. A friend, who has been using this for a while swears by Aveeno lotion. There are many types of Aveeno lotions in this line, be sure to pick the one whose picture you see above.

One very cool thing about Aveeno lotion with SPF 15 is the moisturizing effect. Aveeno lotion is even though thick not oily. When you apply it to your body, it has a very good coverage and still doesn&#x2019;t feel heavy on your skin.

### Aveeno lotion with SPF 15 ingredients

Avobenzone 3%, octinoxate 7.5%, octisalate 2%, Water, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, glycine soja (soybean) seed extract, glycerin, bis-phenylpropyl dimethicone, arachidyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, cetearyl glucoside, panthenol, benzyl alcohol, ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer, behenyl alcohol, steareth-2, fragrance, steareth-21, polyacrylamide, polymethyl methacrylate, arachidyl glucoside, disodium EDTA, methylparaben, C13-14 isoparaffin, ethylparaben, butylparaben, laureth-7, benzalkonium chloride, propylparaben, isobutylparaben, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, BHT, titanium dioxide, mica, silica.

## Carrot Glow Intense Toning Beauty Milk

![Carrot Glow Intense Toning Beauty Milk](images\Carrot-Glow-Intense-Toning-Beauty-Milk.jpg)

No, I was not ever going to miss this one. **Carrot Glow Intense Toning Beauty Milk** is one of the most popular body creams for people with fair skin. In fact, it seems to me as a staple for fair complexioned skins in Nigeria. Almost every girl has at one point or the other used Carrot Glow Intense Toning Beauty Milk.

Now, what I think is that people go for this beauty milk because it helps you to maintain your light glow. Even if you have another body cream, using this once in a while just helps you maintain your skin colour.

Now, I must be very truthful with you here, you have to be careful with this body cream. You just have to be sensitive if your sole aim is not to totally bleach your skin. Even if it is, watch out for your knuckles, knees etc. If you see anything off in 3 weeks to 1 month, stop using immediately.

For example, [when I began to use my best facial cleaner for a while](https://estheradeniyi.com/dermaliss-lotion-facial-cleanser-review/), I realized that it was beginning to cause some bleaching, I drastically reduced the frequency of usage. It still remains my best though, you may click to read my review to understand why.

### Carrot Glow Intense Toning Beauty Milk Ingredients

Aqua (Water), Glyceryl Stearate, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG 100-Stearate, Almond Oil, Glycerin, Morus Alba Root Extract, Citrus Limonum, Dimethicone, Arbutin, Lanolin Oil, Decyl Oleate, Propylene Glycole, Aloe Vera Extract, Paraffinum, (Mineral Oil), Parfum (Fragrance), Sodium Lactate, Carrot Seed Oil, Octyl Dimethyl PABA, Allantoin, Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin K, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Vitamin E, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Metabisulfite, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium-EDTA, Licorice Extract.

### Carrot Glow Intense Toning Beauty Milk Review

I have put this review up here so that you can objectively assess the lotion. Some of the comments may help you make a decision.

## Fair & Brite &#x2013; Extreme Skin Radiance Brightening Lotion

![Fair &amp; Brite &#x2013; Extreme Skin Radiance Brightening Lotion](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fair-Brite-&#x2013;-Extreme-Skin-Radiance-Brightening-Lotion.jpg)

This is also really good for people with fair skin in Nigeria. Even though it has hydroquinone, it is in really fair proportions and not as concentrated as some of the other body creams that have a really bad side effect.

Regular use of this cream will help you restore back to normal if you have already begun to experience blackening by our Nigerian sun.

## Jergens Shea Butter Deep Conditioning Moisturizer

![Jergens Shea Butter Deep Conditioning Moisturizer](images\Jergens-Shea-Butter-Deep-Conditioning-Moisturizer.png)

**Now Jergens Shea Butter Deep Conditioning Moisturizer** is a very soft and subtle cream for fair people in Nigeria looking to achieve a faster result. It smells really nice and works like the way Nivea Natural Fairness works. I find that even people with chocolate skin can use this body cream without any side effect.

### Jergens Shea Butter Deep Conditioning Moisturizer Ingredients

Water, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, stearic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone, octyldodecyl myristate, hydroxyethyl urea, mineral oil, ceteareth-20, cetyl esters, ethylhexyl isononanoate, hydrogenated polydecene, methylparaben, dmdm hydantoin, mangifera indica (mango) seed butter, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, arginine, sodium hydroxide, fragrance, propylparaben, carbomer, caramel, tocopheryl acetate.

## No body cream!

So, while I was speaking with someone about this post, she mentioned that she doesn&#x2019;t use any body cream on her face, maybe on her legs, but not on all her body or face. She is light skinned and claims that the use of body creams makes her darker.

I am not very sure I should be recommending this kind of skin care regimen even though I have heard a number of people talk about it. I, however, think that this is something you can try out if you are looking to experiment and know what works well with your fair skin.

Just make sure you moisturize your facial skin well at least. If you would like to check out a good moisturizer, read my review here of [Sandalwood Moisturizing cream](https://estheradeniyi.com/sandalwood-moisturizing-cream-by-young-living-essential-oils/) by Young Living Essential oils. You can also try to check out other moisturizers that are close to you and within your reach. I have not yet found where to get Sandalwood in Nigeria just yet.

## Use of essential oils

Lavender, sandalwood and olive essential oils have been proven to be some of the best essential oils for fair skinned complexioned people. There are sure some other essential oils such as blackcurrant seed essential oil, almond essential oil, argan essential oil and rose essential oil.

When it comes to skin lightening, lemon oil is the best of them all because it contains limonene and citric acid. Tea tree oil helps to remove scars and lighten dark spots.

Essential oils are probably your best bet when looking for absolutely natural beauty solutions for your skin care routine. It is however advised that you never ever use these oils without diluting. At least for a start, to be sure that this is good for your skin. Another way is to do a patch test.

If you missed the last essential oil training in Lagos, well, you have another shot to learn about essential oils but this time, in Ilorin, Kwara state.

So, if you are in Ilorin and are interested in this free essential oil class, simply chat me up on 08167009081 .

**The training will cover the following:**

- why &#x2018;everyone&#x2019; is talking about essential oils
- benefits of the most common essential oils
- how to use them for general well being, skincare, haircare etc, and
- where to buy original essential oils.
- You can choose to come to the training on any of the days from September 6 to September 10. The venue will be duly communicated to registered participants.

See you there!

If you eventually want to try out essential oils for natural skin care, check this link to buy [original, unadulterated essential oils](https://estheradeniyi.com/buy-original-essential-oils/) right here in Nigeria.

These are the **best body creams for fair skin in Nigeria** that I can think of. If you have any other, please share with us in the comments section too. If I also get suggestions and more information about some of the body creams already written, I will be sure to include them all here.
