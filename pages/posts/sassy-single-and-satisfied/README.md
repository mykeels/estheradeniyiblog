## This excerpt is taken from Sassy, Single and Satisfied by Michelle Hammond

&#x201C;Many would say [they feel loved](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/I-love-you-messages-for-him) based on what others do for them. One
 fondly remembers the day someone gave her flowers. Or soothed her
 pain. Or took the time to go out of his way to do something for her. She
 reflects upon these moments as expressions of true love.

But can you
 really tell? Some people are nice for different reasons. To gain
 approval. To prove their own worth. To get something they want from you.

[The true&#xA0;language&#xA0;of love](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-to-love) is willing sacrifice. This is seldom
 thought of as we pursue finding the one true love of our lives. How much
 are you willing to sacrifice to have what you want? Your life as you
 know it to&#xA0;accommodate&#xA0;the interest of another?

A dream that would
 interfere with your beloved&#x2019;s? This is important. This is big. Think
 about what you would be willing to sacrifice for the love you want. Now
 translate that into acts of kindness in the lives of those who are
 available to be loved in your world at this very moment.

How much are are you willing to sacrifice?&#x201D;
