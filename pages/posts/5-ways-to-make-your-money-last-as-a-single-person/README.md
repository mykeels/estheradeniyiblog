I was on my own jejely on Saturday when I stumbled on Oluwafunmbi Purpose&#x2019;s post on **how to make your money last as a single. **I am not going to keep this one to myself so, enjoy the semi hilarious suggestions by Oluwafunmbi:

1. Trust God for direction and guidance on things to do; he will help you not to be a spendthrift.

2. Don&#x2019;t have unprotected sex/Stay chaste; you will not be buying antibiotics to treat infection or postinor to prevent pregnancy.

3. Fast and pray often; fasting will make your food last.

4. Eat healthy; junks take more money and won&#x2019;t keep you in shape, you&#x2019;ll end up buying slimming tea and skipping rope to keep yourself in shape.

5. Rest; you will spend less on transport for visiting friends unnecessarily.

Oya my people, come and drop your own in the comments section.
