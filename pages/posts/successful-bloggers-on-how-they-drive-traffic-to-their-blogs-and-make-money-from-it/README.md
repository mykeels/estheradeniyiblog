I asked three successful Bloggers to share some very profound blogging tips with me so that I can in turn share with you. These Bloggers have been able to whip out success from their blogs and most of all, they enjoy blogging so much that you cannot help but be curious.

I had the privilege of learning from each one of them. What I did was ask them all the same questions. I needed to know how they generate that much traffic and engagement from their blogs. I was also honestly curious about their blog monetization model.

Their responses were blogging tutorials for me on an entirely different level. The advice they also had to give new bloggers is not one to miss at all. Not only should you read their responses but digest them and immediately map out an action plan for your blogging journey right away. It is totally worth it!

*1. What is your major source of traffic and how do you generate traffic through this channel?*

Facebook. What I do is, after publishing a blog post, I share the link on my Facebook wall and page. I also create awareness on my Facebook stories.

*2 What other channel(s) are you looking to drive blog traffic from?*

Pinterest.

I&#x2019;m learning to drive traffic from Pinterest to my blog. Instagram too. I&#x2019;m also looking at an offline method where I get to give out t-shirts, pens, make stickers for books and cars.

*3. In your own opinion, what method of driving blog traffic is the best so far?*

Building a strong audience first on one or two of the social media platforms work really good. Create awareness outside and let people trust the content you can deliver.

*4. How can new Bloggers begin to drive massive traffic to their blogs?*

Consistency. One of the things that helped me was that I was already very consistent with sharing content on Facebook so I had built a good following. When I push my link to them, they know what they were going to get. I learned that people don&#x2019;t just click on links except it interests them or they know the blogger and have been impacted by that person.

Then consistency in publishing blog posts. When I started Ifegrace.com&#x2026; even though a good number of people were visiting, I wasn&#x2019;t happy. I felt I was doing so much with little results. But I continued. Consistency became my thing. I pushed these links to people&#x2019;s faces. I talked about my blog. I researched and before I knew it, I was seeing better results.

Another thing is the content. When people visit the blog, will they be looking forward to the next blog post? New bloggers should give each blog post the best shot. It&#x2019;s worth it.

*5. How do you make money from your blog? *

For now, I make money from my e-books. I am already making moves to include other means.

Thank you, Esther.

*1. What is your major source of traffic and how do you generate traffic through this channel?*

Blogging is like a jigsaw made of several pieces to fix the puzzle; there is the optimization, monetization, traffic orientation, technical and skillful acquisition; from getting a domain name, hosting, designing, selecting the best plugins and creating compelling content,&#xA0; knowing when and how to simultaneously combine and assemble each of these pieces to create a balanced picture.

There are several trails, routes, traffic channels to drive adequate monthly visitors to your website/blog and as a blogger, you have to intelligently be updated about the several channels and learn how to get around a few of them at least employing 2 sources of traffic.

Pinterest is by far and away my number one source of traffic. Pinterest is an online search engine that allows you to share images through social networking, and it is so sad to see a lot of Bloggers walk down the line of reluctance in employing Pinterest to drive a good amount of traffic to their website. I have told a lot of Bloggers to get around Pinterest but they just ditch the exchange of time and sacrifice to know how the system works thereby missing a whole lot of traffic.

Pinterest has been my major source of traffic since I started blogging a few months ago and it has greased my journey with ease and financial empowerment. I don&#x2019;t just get a tangible amount of visitors but impactful and meaningful connections have been derived from the community.

To adequately drive traffic from Pinterest, I always endeavor to create quality and valuable content and then proceed to create aesthetic premium call to action pins. Pinterest is all about visuals and to stand out from the crowd you have to employ a sense of aesthetic in your organization and designs to grab the attention of people. Another thing I do is to pin CONSISTENTLY.

Consistent hard work leads to success, greatness will come. Consistent pinning leads to rewards. Traffic will come&#x2026;lol. This is a major key to my huge success on Pinterest. I pin every day shuffling my pins between hours and observed optimal time. On a bad day, I make up to 40 pins so you can imagine the level of consistency I have employed on Pinterest.

And the good thing about it is that the more you design the more you become observant and you game how the system works for you.

*2 What other channel(s) are you looking to drive blog traffic from?*

Truth is that if you are relying on one source of traffic you&#x2019;ll end up chased by the algorithm change every now and then. You are more like taking a crocked road down your Blogging journey and I bet nobody wants to get crushed.

The best thing to do is to diversify your source of traffic and with that been said, I am currently working my way around driving traffic from Google (SEO). Thousands of people swear that Google pushes a constant amount of traffic to them and I am trying to get around SEO optimization to get those traffic booming in.

*3. In your own opinion, what method of driving blog traffic is the best so far?*

There isn&#x2019;t really one source of magical traffic but for me the best type of traffic to drive your blog is Pinterest.

Firstly, you gain traffic on time to your blog. Earlier this month I launched my second blog and by employing tactical Pinterest tips it received a substantial flux of traffic in a few hours that the Blog was ready for monetization. You can imagine! I was so shocked and surprised rather than rallying in loneliness in the early phase of Blogging you can drive a whole lot of traffic from Pinterest within days.

Secondly, with Pinterest, you can ridiculously climb high on the ranking charts and earn so much more money due to the relevance and importance placed on the clicks and impression on your ads coming from Pinterest.

*4. How can new Bloggers begin to drive massive traffic to their blogs?*

And as a new blogger still testing the waters, Pinterest can help you quickly push a huge sum of traffic to your website, you simply have to keep producing quality content, researching, learning, and experimenting.

The major mistake I made through my Blog traffic generation was relying solely on one source of traffic, that stuff is deadly! Don&#x2019;t ever do that, diversify. Like if something happened to Pinterest I&#x2019;ll be gone so currently I am working my way around Google as a safety net.

*5. How do you make money from your blog?*

Currently, my major source of monetization is through ads, I run ads with mediavine ad network and I have gotten a lot of dough from the ad network, it&#x2019;s one of the best, better than Google AdSense as it deals majorly with impression rather than clicks alone.

Blog traffic generation entails a lot, but the major key is to create valuable content, learn more and be confident enough to experiment.

*1. What is your major source of traffic and how do you generate traffic through this channel?*

My major source of traffic has been google. Since I started learning about SEO, I found out about how to satisfy searcher&#x2019;s intent. That has really helped in driving traffic to the site.

The second means is through WhatsApp. We have a 3 WhatsApp groups where we attend to people&#x2019;s music requests, and when and where needed, we share links from the blog with them. This helps in more of the returning users.

*2 What other channel(s) are you looking to drive blog traffic from?*

Will love to drive traffic from Twitter especially, because of the way conversations go on the platform.

*3. In your own opinion, what method of driving blog traffic is the best so far?*

Search Engine is the best. But in the case when customer retention works well, it will be highly profitable in the long run, especially in the times when google releases updates that could affect the blog.

*4. How can new Bloggers begin to drive massive traffic to their blogs?*

First, you need to understand your niche, second.. find out about what people are searching for and others are not willing to write about, this makes you a genuine and the number 1 go-to source.

One of the mistakes I made in my early days of blogging was to be the blog with the latest news/updates. This only brought intangible traffic to the site and some posts that took lots of stress to write didn&#x2019;t come with appreciable traffic. But when I started attending to people&#x2019;s queries, it gave me the opportunity for more evergreen contents. This has brought more users to the site.

Here you go, I hope that this has been an eye-opener and that you are able to begin something worthwhile as regards blog development.

If this has been helpful to you, would you kindly share with other Bloggers within your radar? Thank you.
