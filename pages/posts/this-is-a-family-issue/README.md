I am happy this is coming at a time I was going to discard something that has been impressed upon my heart to share for a while. We are going to have a church in here and this is going to be freedom laced in truth for you. It&#x2019;s time to walk out on condemnation because enough is enough. Really!

How far have you fallen? Oh yeah, we decided to do this from the bottom. Let&#x2019;s get this over with once and for all. How far have you fallen? How deep have you messed up? How bad is it already? Because, right now, you have given up on God. Just because&#x2026;

Just because you think that you are a total disappointment. Funny thing is that you&#x2019;d rather continue wallowing in your mistakes than admit that you have made them already and move on in Faith.

Let me tell you what is happening? You are being condemned. Let me also announce to you the culprit, the devil. Only he is gifted with the package of condemnation. He&#x2019;s so good at it.

But guess what y&#x2019;all. This is a family issue!

It is between you and God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit. So y&#x2019;all gon sort this out. Only that you have invited the devil to be part of the meeting. Worse off, you listen to him instead. So sad.

**See Romans 8: 33-34**

&#x201C;Who will accuse God&#x2019;s chosen people? God himself declares them not guilty!

Who, then, will condemn them? Not Christ Jesus, who died, or rather, who was raised to life and is at the right-hand side of God, pleading with him for us!&#x201D;

Listen,

You have fallen short of God&#x2019;s glory and are ashamed of his presence. You are ashamed to embrace his free love but candidly;

God is the judge of this and he has declared you not guilty. Yo man! Jesus, your intercessor and the Holy Spirit, your own personal peace and comfort.

This is so family ish. Why have you invited the devil over for dinner?

He doesn&#x2019;t have a say in family matters. He is not even welcome to sit. Check his last name, check yours.

He has condemned you enough. Ask him to cycle back to where he&#x2019;s come from and go meet your family members.

These folks only convict you of your sins, they bring you to genuine repentance and that&#x2019;s that! No condemnation, no guilt tripping, no embrassment, just forgiveness.

So I ask again, why has the devil been given that much power? Strip him off of what you have handed him, the power to condemn you. Move out in the love of God and embrace what he has called you into.

No outsider is permitted to cause you sadness and perpetual guilt. You have been given the joy of the Lord, so walk in it now. Be restored into his Light and have fun basking in all of his awesomeness.
