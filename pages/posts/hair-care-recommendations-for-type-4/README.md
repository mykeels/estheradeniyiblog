In my last post, I talked about different [hair types, Type 4](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/knowing-your-hair-type-type-4-hair?m=1). Today we&#x2019;re looking at how to care for each type. Enjoy your way through the post.

Hair Care Recommendations for 4A Naturalists

Caring for 4a hair begins with the wash method. Use a sulfate-free shampoo to cleanse your hair followed by a moisturizing conditioner to keep your 4A curls hydrated and to prevent the hair from becoming dry. Sulfates can cause dryness to natural hair so it should only be used periodically for deep-cleaning the hair when needed.

Do not comb when wet cause it&#x2019;s in its most fragile state when wet. Concentrate on just the scalp and not the hair itself when washing.

A deep bi-weekly [deep conditioning](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/5-steps-to-deep-condition-your-hair?m=1) will help to strengthen and fortify hair.

Hair Care Recommendations for 4B Naturalists

Always apply a moisturizing conditioner to restore hydration after every wash. If your hair feels weak or lacks elasticity, use a protein conditioner to strengthen the hair follicles and prevent breakage. Protein conditioners should not be used regularly only when needed. Deep conditioners can be used once a week or when needed to repair any damage or provide maximum moisture for your hair.

Natural hair wigs is a definite way to retain length and give your hair a break. Some naturals have even opted to use frontal hair pieces is also a good method of protective styling

Hair Care Recommendations for 4C Naturalists

Use a sulfate-free shampoo and follow with a creamy moisturizing conditioner for restoring moisture and also help with detangling the hair. Use a wide-tooth comb while in the shower to remove tangles starting from the ends of the hair and working upwards.

Type 4C hair should be moisturized and conditioned regularly to prevent the hair from appearing dull. Because the hair strands of 4C are so tightly compacted, this texture is more prone to breakage than any other hair texture. A deep conditioner can be utilized once a week or as often as needed to soften, strengthen, and moisturize the hair. Type 4C hair loves creamy butters, moisturizing products, and natural oils and butters to hydrate the hair and retain moisture.

Wearing protective styles such as wigs, twists, braids, locs, and tucked hairstyles will prevent the hair from shedding faster than it can grow. Sew-in extensions are also a popular protective style for women with natural 4C hair because the hair is braided and hidden while wearing the style.
