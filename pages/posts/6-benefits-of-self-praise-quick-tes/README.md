 How does it sound &#xA0;when we acknowledge other people&#x2019;s looks, behaviours, work, &#xA0;attitude, or just their simplicity? &#xA0;Have you ever thought of replicating that to your self? &#xA0;Have &#xA0;you thought of the good &#xA0;and powerful result &#xA0;self praise &#xA0;will &#xA0;do to you and your productivity? Not to worry &#xA0;we shall &#xA0;discuss &#xA0;that &#xA0;today.

 People &#xA0;often &#xA0;mistake &#xA0;self praise for pride. They say, &#x201C;When &#xA0;you praise &#xA0;your self, you &#xA0;are being proud and heading&#x201D; I call self praise your support &#xA0;system, appreciating your true &#xA0;self, how you feel &#xA0;about &#xA0;yourself, how marvellous your creator has made you&#x2026;&#x2026;. It&#x2019;s not the same as being arrogant.
In fact, you can be so proud of yourself &#xA0;and achievement. You need to first see how good you are before others can see &#xA0;it. Self praise &#xA0;comes &#xA0;from &#xA0;the satisfaction you have about yourself instead of wallowing in self pity. Self praise is the antidote to self pity.&#xA0;

 Words and imagination play an important role in making you become better. Until &#xA0;your &#xA0;words &#xA0;and imagination &#xA0;are affirmative enough to help &#xA0;you take the right &#xA0;decisions, you might find &#xA0;yourself waiting &#xA0;for the approval &#xA0;of people &#xA0;before &#xA0;forging ahead &#xA0;with &#xA0;things &#xA0;in your &#xA0;life, which &#xA0;might eventually &#xA0;not come.

 Like &#xA0;I tell &#xA0;people, :you are responsible for your &#xA0;happiness, and your &#xA0;happiness comes from &#xA0;how you see and acknowledge yourself. You might have gone through &#xA0;a lot, and you have lost the reason &#xA0;why you should &#xA0;praise yourself, in fact &#xA0;you may not see any reason &#xA0;why you should.

###  So, &#xA0;here are 6 benefits of self praise&#xA0;

 In one of our trainings we took &#xA0;people &#xA0;through &#xA0;the process &#xA0;of &#xA0;self praise and these are some &#xA0;of the feedback we got

 &#x201C;When I started, I almost stopped. It was hard to admire me. I had to force myself to believe what I knew about myself all along but always admired it in others. &#xA0;At a point, I started checking the time. I later calmed a bit, hugged and peck myself&#x201D;.

 Another participant said :

 &#x201C;For me &#xA0;it was difficult for me to praise myself but I was able to. I was able to achieve 2 minutes, then i tried again with a timer. And as I went to bed I realised i wasn&#x2019;t all bad, that there was a lot of good in me. It was emotional&#x201D;.

###  So let go back to the benefits of self praise&#xA0;

 1. It energises you to be the best you can be&#xA0;

 2. It helps you &#xA0;see the possibilities in things around &#xA0;you.&#xA0;

 3. It reduces negative vibes around you .

 4. It allows you love yourself and accept you for who you are .

 5. It gives you confidence to face your fears.&#xA0;

 6. The more you praise &#xA0;yourself, the more you &#xA0;see and realise solutions embedded in you.

 Let do a quick test.

 Take the next 5 minutes (or squeeze out 5 minutes of your day today) to acknowledge and praise every good thing in you. Or you can do it before you start your daily activities. &#xA0;It will help your day I tell &#xA0;you.

 Step &#xA0;out into the week with &#xA0;your head up high and stop &#xA0;the self pity. &#xA0;Embrace the remaining part of you, nurture, beautify and praise yourself.

 Make &#xA0;it a daily life style. Be the best you can be Now.
