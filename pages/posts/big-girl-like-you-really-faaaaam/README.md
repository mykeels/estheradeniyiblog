I boarded my ride and he started my trip. He had not moved an inch when he began to complain. He said he had been on that route before and there&#x2019;s a lot of traffic.

I was surprised tho&#x2019;. I told him where I was going even before he started the trip. Well, all was fine and good. So I asked what he thought we could do.

I began to search Google maps and also think of alternative routes. Everywhere I mentioned, he said something ill about the route. So I asked him (again) what he proposed we do.

Guess what his proposal was, we should go offline.

Bros, from 100 to -67. Offline ke? How is that supposed to be an option?

I was desperate to get home so that might have been no problem save for that it was kind of off. I also remembered at that point some of the bizarre stories I had heard of people who went offline.

Most of the time, it seemed to go south!

My immediate response to &#x2018;let&#x2019;s go offline&#x2019; was &#x2018;ah&#x2019;.

I sat there thinking of the next thing to do &#x2013; order another ride, book a yellow taxi, take a bike, walk down to board a bus (I had no cash, so I would have to withdraw).

He mentioned that it would not be much, around 2,000 Naira. My people, my ride estimate was 600-800 Naira on the app.

What I was considering wasn&#x2019;t even the money he would charge offline but my safety and any other thing I might not be thinking about.

I told him to cancel my trip, I would like to book another ride. It was so clear to me, there was no traffic jam, I take that route everyday. He just wanted to go offline and for what ever reason- more money, something shady, I wasn&#x2019;t even ready to think. I just needed him to cancel my ride.

Guess what came next, &#x2018;big girl like you&#x2019;.

This was where all the bolts in my head loosened.

&#x2018;What?&#x2019;

&#x2018;It&#x2019;s not much o, it will be around 2500&#x2019;, he even inflated by 500 Naira.

&#x2018;Unku unku, please open the door!&#x2019; I barked. &#x2018;If this is what big girls do, I am not a big girl. Please open your door!&#x2019;

He unlocked and asked me to cancel the ride. I reminded him, he already started the ride without my permission. I couldn&#x2019;t even cancel an ongoing ride.

He did and mhen, I walked away fast.

&#x2018;Big girl like you&#x2019;, that was such a mistake!

What was that going to make me do? Pay him 2500 Naira to save face?

I don&#x2019;t get it. Big girls are smart. Big girls don&#x2019;t waste money. Big girls know when someone is trying to rip off some extra, unnecessary cash.

Big girls can smell a corporate thief. So if anyone&#x2019;s definition of &#x2018;big girl&#x2019; is a reckless spender, we might need to call for a redefinition!
