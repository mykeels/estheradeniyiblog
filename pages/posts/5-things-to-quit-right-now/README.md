5 Things to Quit Right Now is inspired by a picture I saw on Instagram. A fellow blogger &#x2013; [Jopasdaughter](http://www.jopasdaughter.com/)&#xA0;posted&#xA0;this and I got to find out that it is a popular image circulating round. I pondered on more than one of the points and then decided to make it into an article.

There is a need to constantly quit things. We need to keep upgrading and reshuffling many aspects of our lives because after a while, we are left with a clutter of rubbish. My advice? Declutter. Keep decluttering until you are inspired to declutter more.

It&#x2019;s very easy to accumulate baggage in relationships &#x2013; intra-relationships and interrelationships. The sooner we recognize how much these things slow us down, the better and quicker we get to achieving a peaceful and fulfilling life. Here are [5 things to quit right now](https://tinybuddha.com/fun-and-inspiring/5-things-quit-right-now/)

## Trying to please everyone

Omg, I was a pro at this one. I usually wanted everyone to have only positive thoughts about me. I would as a result go to absolutely ridiculous lengths to please everyone around me. Little did I know that this had a lot to say about my esteem.

As soon as I became free of this silly behavior, I had so much peace in my life. Listen, you cannot please everyone. In trying to please everyone, you would still displease a lot, you would displease yourself and be left with a frustrated you. Quit it.

## Fearing change

We are all used to the popular talk about the fact that change is constant. Yes, &#xA0;it is. Change is something we should long for. Never fear to change your career or job if it doesn&#x2019;t bring fulfillment. Do not be afraid to change your style, your approach to life, your love relationships. Quit fearing change, it is necessary.

## Living in the past

If you won&#x2019;t let the past go, &#xA0;if you let it linger and dominate the present, it will affect the quality of living. The past is in the past so leave it there. It&#x2019;s time to move on. It&#x2019;s time to look for new opportunities and explore new fields. Let the regrets lay low and use the chance you have to live today to turn things around.

## Putting yourself down

Do you ever have to put yourself down to prove a point? Quit that now. Do you have to relegate yourself and discard your personality to make a few people pleased, stop that very soon, in fact, now. You matter a lot, &#xA0;especially to yourself.

So, &#xA0;never feel as if you have to be lower than someone to be lifted up in any ramification of life- in your relationships, career etc. Even God wants us to always approach him in boldness.

## Overthinking

Overthinking will not solve anything. It is such a drainer . Overthinking isn&#x2019;t what you are supposed to be doing, action is what you should be taking. Do not form the habit of organizing pity parties for yourself. Quit worrying.
