Heeeeeeeeey fellow Naturalistas, &#xA0;how are the strands doing? I am writing about **shea butter** today because after coconut oil, it&#x2019;s my best hair product and the benefits of shea butter are endless. I am currently using a processed shea butter product. I use it as my body cream too and I really love it. Shea butter is bae, very bae. In fact, you don&#x2019;t have to be on natural hair to tap into the goodness.

To reap the **benefits of shea butter**, it&#x2019;s is important to buy premium grade, quality and pure. If you are buying a processed grade, be sure that you can trust the brand. A lot of shea butter we buy are mixed with useless substances, substances that may not only water down the positive effects of the butter but even cause damage to your hair.

Below are the **benefits of shea butter** :

- [2 2. It softens dry and brittle hair](#2_It_softens_dry_and_brittle_hair)
- [3 3. Seals in moisture](#3_Seals_in_moisture)

## 1. It Soothes dry scalp

Shea butter helps to soothe and moisturize dry scalp. If you have dry scalp, shea butter is an excellent moisturizer. What I like about it is that it is quickly absorbed into your scalp. It doesn&#x2019;t have the messy feeling because after a while, it is quickly absorbed.

## 2. It softens dry and brittle hair

Another benefit of shea butter is that it is a very good conditioner for dry hair. As soon as I am done washing my hair, &#xA0;I apply shea butter to make it soft. My project mate during my masters really liked to use it on her daughter. It helps keep her natural hair soft and silky.

## 3. Seals in moisture

Did you read that [LOC method article on my blog last year](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/natural-hair-what-is-loc-method?m=1), &#xA0;shea butter can stand in for the C-cream. It helps to seal in moisture. If you are on natural hair, &#xA0;you know how quickly natural hair dries off. Shea butter helps to seal moisture in after you have just finished washing and/or shampooing.

Do you use shea butter? How do you like it? Do you know of any other benefits of shea butter you might like to share? Please share in the comments section.
