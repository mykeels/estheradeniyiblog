**Bloggers in Nigeria** have in the past few years brought blogging in Nigeria to the fore. There was a time when Blogging was as abstract as being a writer. If you told anyone that you were a Blogger, in Nigeria, way back, they would give you the &#x2018;do I also need to ask you to explain further&#x2019; face.

Thankfully, maybe graciously, some [**Naija Bloggers**](https://estheradeniyi.com/nigerian-bloggers-my-top-5-favorites/) have given us many reasons to not have to explain what it means to be a Blogger in Nigeria anymore. Blogging has earned for itself a decent name in Nigeria and that&#x2019;s a big relief.

Today, I have decided to make a list of the **popular Naija Bloggers** we have and what I have learned from them. It is a list of 5 most **influential and successful Bloggers in Nigeria.**&#xA0;I will not only share the names of these Naija Bloggers, I will say why they inspire me and what I learned from their Blogging in Nigeria.

If you however have a Blogger in mind, you can mention in the comments section, please also share what you have learned from them.

## 1. Linda Ikeji

**Linda Ikeji** is the goddess of Naija Blogging. I don&#x2019;t want to imagine what would have happened if she didn&#x2019;t buy a house in Banana Island. Okay, kidding. Lol. But really, many people didn&#x2019;t know how much of prospects blogging had until she bought that house. I know I am not lying.

Her blog, **Lindaikejisblog.com** is an entertainment blog. Because of her rise to successful blogging in Nigeria, the average person in Nigeria thinks every Blogger in Nigeria is a celebrity gossip. That actually gets me, argggrrrrrrrh&#x2026;

Her blog has gained popularity in Nigeria, Africa and the whole world. On her blog are latest news updates, entertainment, lifestyle and juicy stuff to keep you glued.

Don&#x2019;t ever make the mistake of opening her blog if you really didn&#x2019;t intend staying, you might stay there for longer than you thought.

### What I have learned from Linda Ikeji

**Grit**. You see, grit is pushing through odds and challenges like you see your victorious end. I think that this is what so many other Bloggers need to learn. They need to learn how to push through blogging challenges to continue blogging.

Despite her financial struggles and failed ventures, Linda Ikeji kept on blogging and longing for the light at the end of the tunnel.

## 2. Uche Eze Pedro

**Uche Pedro** is the founder of BellaNaija, an entertainment and lifestyle blog. There is virtually nothing missing in there. One of the most prominent segments of Bella Naija blog is the Wedding category.

Weddings are painted red on Bella Naija. It&#x2019;s also one of the most popular segments of the Naija blog. Bella Naija covers news, politics, music, movies, celebrity gists, feminine stuff and every other thing to keep you entertained.

### What I have learned from Uche Eze

**Consistency**. Bella Naija is one of the **pioneer blogs in Nigeria**. People who kept on blogging when Nigeria was ignorant of it are the big deal.

Constantly doing something over and over and forging on to keeping it better and almost formidable is something every Naija Blogger should learn from.

## 3. Noble Igwe

**Noble Igwe** is the founder of **360 Nobs**, a lifestyle and general blog. Prominent on 360 Nobs is music. Other segments include news, opinions, lifestyle , entertainment etc.

### What I have learned from Noble Igwe

**Boldness**. I see Noble Igwe do his things the way he wants it. When he takes a part of the industry, he does so without flinching. If you always have to look left and right or beg for approval to be what you want to be, you better hold on on it and gain clarity.

## 4. Sisi Yemmie

**Sisi Yemmie** is the owner of **Sisiyemmie.com**. Her blog is a Nigerian food and lifestyle blog. It also features a lot of her daily living and personal lifestyle. It is a blog with an exceptional glamour and many things satisfying.

### What I like about Sisi Yemmie

**Quality**. When I first started blogging, I didn&#x2019;t know that people took time to create content with so much details and finesse. She always moved one step better with every new content on her blog. Design, picture quality, article thoroughness, talk about it. Sisi Yemmie has brought some sense into Naija blogs.

## 5. Stella Dimoko Korkos

[**Stella Dimoko Korkos**](https://estheradeniyi.com/stella-dimoko-korkos-biography-blog-pictures-and-sdk-app/) is the owner of **stelladimokokorkos.com**. It is a lifestyle and entertainment blog in Nigeria. When we talk about entertainment and news blogging in Nigeria, her blog is on the same page you&#x2019;d find Linda Ikeji&#x2019;s.

### What I have learned from Stella Dimoko Korkos

**Resilience**. Graduating with a third class is enough to push anyone to the back seat especially in Nigeria. I don&#x2019;t know if people want to give you the benefit of doubt, test your ability and see what you can produce.

Stella Dimoko kept on venturing into things that interested her. From print journalism, she fell in love with online journalism. Here she is today.

There are so many other popular and successful bloggers in Nigeria e.g Jide Ogunsanya, Ono Bello, Japhet Joshua Omojuwa, Demola Ogundele, Onibalusi Bamidele etc. Hopefully I can make a much more comprehensive list of naija blogs that might interest you.

In conclusion, blogging in Nigeria has evolved. I want to therefore advise that you come in with your A-game if you want to become a blogger in Nigeria.

[Staying mediocre may not really help](https://estheradeniyi.com/why-you-are-not-serious-with-your-blog/) much so get into blogging with as much finesse as you can wield.
