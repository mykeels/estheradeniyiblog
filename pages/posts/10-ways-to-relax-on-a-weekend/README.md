Hey! The week is officially over. If you are as exhausted as I am, yaaaay because [@smartbizinabox](https://instagram.com/smartbizinabox?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;igshid=11xfanfkr52qt) has decided that we are about to have the most relaxed weekend ever.

I would not pass on this if I were you, so here, quick tips for you to get your shorts and flops to work.

1&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Take a power nap when you can, this will help you feel refreshed
 &#x2796; Time investment: 15-20 minutes
 .
 2&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Take a walk, and trust me you&#x2019;ll feel more focused and energised after
 &#x2796; Time investment: 15 minutes .
 .
 3&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Unplug &#x2013; it&#x2019;s easier said than done, I know! But sometimes stepping away from your phone and the internet can help you focus on important things such as recharging or quality family time. .
 .
 4&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Go for a run if a run is more your style. This is good for your heart, your head and tour overall health.
 &#x2796; Time investment: 30 minutes
 .
 5&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Eat lighter foods today, this will make you feel better and more refreshed
 .
 6&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Put your worries away, write down whatever you&#x2019;re worried about, put it away in a cupboard, and also from your mind, and just have a good time.
 &#x2796; Time investment: 5 minutes
 .
 7&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Read a book, preferably your favourite genre (romance or comic) doesn&#x2019;t have to be a business book.
 &#x2796; Time investment: 30 minutes
 .
 8&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Pamper yourself, eat your favourite snacks, drink your favourite wine, have a soak in the bath, get a manicure and pedicure, and a mud mask facial. Whatever makes you happy, do it.
 &#x2796; Time investment: 60 minutes
 .
 9&#xFE0F;&#x20E3; Spend time with family and friends, people who can make you laugh out loud all day, till you no longer remember your worries or your long to-do list.
 &#x2796; Time investment: 60 minutes
 .
 ? Do something you love that&#x2019;s just for you, I recommend [going to the cinema](https://estheradeniyi.com/ozone-cinemas-yaba/) alone, and order a big pack of popcorn all to yourself. Or stay at home to write, paint, or bake a cupcake. .
 &#x2796; Time investment: 60 minutes

 So what is it going to be for you? Mine is 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10. Share yours in the comments.
