I walked into **COZA**, Lagos for the first time four months ago and I have not looked back ever since. At COZA, there&#x2019;s an uplifting of the spirit, the messages have so much of depth that it takes so long to recover from them.

Sometimes I have my sermon notes to use for my quiet time all week round. I have never experienced a newness and freshness of the spirit as I have in COZA. I am spiritually watered and carried!

If we are close, you know I go home every weekend. Around the time I attended COZA, Lagos for the first time, I decided I was going to pick a church here in Lagos and COZA dropped in my heart.

Moreover, since I listened to [The Gratitude, COZA&#x2019;s first album](https://estheradeniyi.com/lyrics-rabababa-eh-gratitude-coza-mp3/), I longed to visit COZA here in Lagos. When I was in Ilorin, I attended a couple of times. They were mostly special services but I left there impacted immensely. The first thing I noticed on walking into the church was the excellence that exuded from every corner.

This is not your traditional kind of spiritual assembly. So, it&#x2019;s in COZA that you have all of it. Spirituality, excellence, swag, vibrancy, depth. I mean, I loved the total package guys.

I remember them asking me to give them 3 months and in less than that I have been pumped up all round. COZA is the place to be if you want everything, I am not bluffing.

I am in this blog post going to try to answer frequently asked questions about The Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA)
