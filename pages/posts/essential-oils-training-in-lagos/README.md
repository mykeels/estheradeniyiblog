**Essential oils** are becoming a large part of our lives as we use them for hair, skin, health and just about almost everything. Essential oils are not so popular as stand-alone therapeutic substances in Nigeria and Africa at large.

This is probably due to the fact that not too many people are even aware of something of such nature. Another reason might be that those who are aware and know of the existence of essential oils do not know how to use them. There are, as a matter of fact, [many essential oils](https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils) from which you can pick for use in almost any area of living.

Well, if you are in Lagos, you might want to come to learn how to use essential oils to support you and your family&#x2019;s health. The best part is that this essential oil class is absolutely free, no payment of any form necessary.

From skincare and haircare to immune system support to emotional wellness, you will learn about all the ways these to use these oils as well as why it is important to eliminate chemicals and toxins from our daily routines.
