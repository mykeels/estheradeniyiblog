I promise you, my **Oceans&#x2019;s 8 movie review** is going to be spoiler free, I will make sure of it. By the end of your watching of the **Ocean&#x2019;s 8 movie trailer**, scanning through the **Ocean&#x2019;s 8 full&#xA0;cast** and reading through my pleasant experience through Ocean&#x2019;s 8, you should find yourself in the cinema. I don&#x2019;t care if it&#x2019;s midnight, lol.

So guys, it&#x2019;s been a very long time I last saw a movie at the cinema. I have been in the middle of hectic work. This afternoon, I decided, it was enough. I needed a break, not inside, not on my bed, but outside. I needed to smell the air, see live cars and sit in an actual cinema. Plus, I miss writing movie reviews.

2 hours after I made the decision, I was in front of the movie ticket stand at [Ozone cinemas](https://estheradeniyi.com/ozone-cinemas-yaba/). In all weirdness, I had nothing in mind, absolutely nothing. My life has been so dry that I had no single movie to anticipate, no movie trailer in my head, nothing people, nothing. I stood staring at the movie list so undecided and a little bit confused.

What if the movie I pay for ends up being boring or not worth it. Movie ticket is 2,000 Naira on Sundays, I can&#x2019;t waste it watching rubbish. So I took a cue, listened in on what other movie ticket buyers were saying. They mostly wanted Jurassic World and Ocean&#x2019;s 8. Ocean&#x2019;s 8 was the next movie showing, so I picked that.

I had met two of the girls who were into Ocean&#x2019;s 8 in the elevator. They seemed to me like people who wouldn&#x2019;t walk into the cinema to watch boredom. So, in faith, I ordered mine.

Oh, before I finally got the conviction to order, I heard one of the girls say excitedly to the other that she couldn&#x2019;t wait to watch Rihanna in Ocean&#x2019;s 8. That was it! I was definitely seeing Ocean&#x2019;s 8.

Debbie Ocean spends 5 years, 8 months and 12 days (most of that in jail) to plan the biggest heist of her life. Having been known to only feel comfortable in the world of crime, she cunningly finds her way out of prison to recruit specialists in different areas &#x2013; Lou Miller, Amita, Constance, Tammy, Nine Ball, and Rose.
