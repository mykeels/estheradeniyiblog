## Medicine by Timi Dakolo lyrics

&#xA0;

### Verse 1

I get sick when I&#x2019;m far away from you for so long
 I lose sleep when I can&#x2019;t get you on the phone
 And it&#x2019;s killing me baby
 Oh I&#x2019;m missing you baby
 Please don&#x2019;t stay away
 I need you everyday

[Only you Jesus by Ada](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/only-you-jesus-by-ada-lyrics-mp3)

&#xA0;

### Verse 2

What we share
 It is so rare, it can&#x2019;t be bought
 Come home please
 Baby let&#x2019;s kiss and talk all night
 &#x2018;Cos I&#x2019;m missing you baby
 And it&#x2019;s killing me baby
 Please don&#x2019;t stay away
 I need you everyday

&#xA0;

### Chorus

Baby o baby!
 You&#x2019;re like medicine to me
 You give me everything I need

### Verse 3

My heart bleeds
 Everytime we fight and you wear a frown
 And I smile!! Every single time that you come around
 Can&#x2019;t do without you
 Built my whole world around you
 Please don&#x2019;t go away
 I need you everyday!!

&#xA0;

### Verse 4

 Oh your words
 They have a way to steal my heart
 And your smile is the medicine that kills my doubts
 Oh my beautiful baby
 Wrap your lovin&#x2019; around me
 Please don&#x2019;t stay away
 I need you everyday!!

Earlier this year, I posted the video of [Medicine by Timi Dakolo](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/watch-medicine-by-timi-dakolo-featthe?m=0). The song had just come out and I was clearly obsessed, to say the least hihihihihihihihihihi&#x2026; It was produced by Cobhams Asuquo. It&#x2019;s far down the release date and I just want you to have the lyrics. I bet you want to love all over again.

Please share this with your friends too.
