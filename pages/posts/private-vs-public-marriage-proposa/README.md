Marriage proposals these days are becoming events people long to experience. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you are not the bride-to-be sef. My people, we love feferity shaaaaaaaaa. Wasn&#x2019;t it our parents the groom would approach many years back? It was so simple back then. Don&#x2019;t you wish we were back in those days? Kidding! Heck no!

Well well well&#x2026; There are many cases of bride-to-be go way emotional during marriage proposals. I like the ones that do so in a cute way, &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t freaking care if it&#x2019;s all staged, just make it cute. Buahahahahahahahaaaa. But you see ehn, I once saw the video of a woman who fainted. Jeez! And it was public. I so wished deep down that it was a private sontin. We would faint ourselves to death and dust off the embarrassment lol. One other girl kept running around without accepting the ring. And that was even a private proposal. Chai.

So, &#xA0;my question is this? Would you prefer a private or public marriage proposal? Why? Join the conversation in the comments section.
