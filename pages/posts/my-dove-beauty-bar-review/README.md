I was introduced to the **Dove Beauty bar** by my roommate. Special shout out to Ogechi, my Portharcourt babe. My regular bath soap had got exhausted that morning and I was stranded. I just couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to go outside to buy a bathing soap. She had an extra Dove Beauty Bar in her wardrobe and that was how I become a Dove Beauty Bar fanatic. What she actually gave to me was the **Dove Purely Pampering Shea butter beauty bar**.

## How I became a Dove Beauty Bar Fanatic

Let me start from the beginning. My hostel is one with hard water. I have never had to use hard water for that long so I didn&#x2019;t know what to expect. [Read my article on what to check before paying for a hostel bed space](https://estheradeniyi.com/before-you-pay-for-that-hostel-bed/). As expected, I used the normal beauty bars or toilet soaps I bought or brought from home every month.

After about 3 months, I began to experience serious body itching and dryness. I overlooked and wished it away until I woke up one morning to body rashes, red patches and a very tight skin.

I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. I thought, this could never, possibly, be hard water. I must have been infected with one of the diseases I see in horror movies. Damn, was I scared. I ended up in the hospital. Apparently, the hard water was the cause. I was given some creams and drugs.

I never ever thought that that water would cause my skin to react because my roommates never reacted. It seemed to me that they already got used to the water. Oge&#x2019;s skin remained particularly fine. I never bothered to inquire though. I couldn&#x2019;t connect a good bathing soap with better skin or hard water antidote.

All I knew was that I liked the scent that came out of the bathroom whenever she had her bath. I used to think that she used a body wash because I just never saw her bathing soap, I wasn&#x2019;t really keen at knowing though.

After I recovered from that major skin hit, I began to desperately look for ways to soften the water. Boy, the water in my hostel was a project! And a very annoying one as that. I used alum at a time, did a lot of stuff. It was pretty stressful to live with that. So, I switched to using sachet water to have my bath.

Yeah, you guessed right! I spent all of my money on sachet water. Y&#x2019;all see why I haven&#x2019;t bought land yet na. This continued until I decided, I would try to make my skin adapt to this water. One month gone and I began to have the skin tightness and dullness come back, a little facial itching too. Very exhausting something, guys.

It was on one of those frustrating days Oge gave me the Dove Purely Pampering Shea butter beauty bar. Guys, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. [I had read some negative reviews about Dove body cream and something bordering around racism.](https://estheradeniyi.com/dove-controversial-advert-lola-ogunyemi/) That got me apprehensive though but well, you try something first, at least.

## Dove Beauty Bar Benefits

The smell of Dove Purely Pampering Shea butter beauty bar is heavenly, to start with. Now, the moisturizing effect! I used this soap and the way my body used to go all dry after bath reduced, in fact, completely stopped. My skin would feel so creamy and soft and supple after bath. People, after using hard water?

Before then, after bath, my body would go tight and dry and really uncomfortable but after using Dove Purely Pampering Shea butter beauty bar, I recovered from that extreme dryness. The moisturizing effect of this beauty bar is so lovely. When I switched to the normal Dove Beauty Bar, it was the same nice effect.

I asked Oge how much she bought it and she said that one goes for around 500 Naira. Truth is that she could not exactly remember how much because she buys all her toiletries the same day. So, well, I decided to open a savings account for Dove Purely Pampering Shea butter beauty bar in my wardrobe. Lol. 500 Naira for one beauty bar, very good na!

After that finished, I couldn&#x2019;t find the Dove Purely Pampering Shea butter beauty bar, so I went for the normal Dove Beauty Bar. I bought the Dove Beauty bar for 250 Naira. I had asked for the shea butter that day and they said they didn&#x2019;t have so I settled for Dove beauty bar and hoped it would be as good as I hoped.

It was as good as the shea butter pampering bar. I loved it so much I went for a pack. Every bar was quickly exhausted because of the hard water. You have to use more soap with hard water.

I tried to intentionally look for Dove Purely Pampering Shea butter beauty bar one day and I was scammed. I bought it for 800 Naira. Guys, I bought it for that much! It was at a store beside my place of work at Opebi. I am one day going to arrest those guys with police. I wish I could mention the name of that store but I am already born again, folks so I would be nice. If you buy things at Opebi, I think you should privately ask me of the name of the store if you don&#x2019;t want to keep on donating to scammers.

Just last week, I began to press the shop I buy my Dove Beauty bar from to try get Dove Purely Pampering Shea butter beauty bar. They got it yesterday and informed me. Guess how much people, 250 Naira. Same price as the Dove Beauty Bar. I kept on asking if this isn&#x2019;t all a mistake. I still think it is though. They will come around if they cheated themselves. I didn&#x2019;t buy it, I still had the Dove Beauty bar at home.

## Final thoughts on Dove Beauty Bar

It is the best body soap so far, for me. I would recommend it to anyone. There are also other bath soap products under this brand, you may try them out too.

Have you used this bath soap before? Do you like it? Please let me hear your thoughts on it.
