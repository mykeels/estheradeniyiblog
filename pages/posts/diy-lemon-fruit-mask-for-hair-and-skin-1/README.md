 I decided to do a post on DIY fruit mask for hair and skin, then I got to realize that if I write everything at once it might be difficult to take in. So, I&#x2019;ve broken it down. I&#x2019;ll do a post, a fruit. It will run for sometime, I hope to cover as many fruits as possible. Today, we&#x2019;ll look at LEMON

 &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; HIGHLIGHTS

- Importance of lemon to the hair
- Lemon for dandruff
- Lemon for hair growth
- Lemon for the skin

 IMPORTANCE OF LEMON TO THE HAIR

- It boosts hair shine and growth
- It helps clear dandruff
- It helps hair loss problems
- It seals cuticle layer so locks in moisture, reduces frizz and define curls

 LEMON FOR DANDRUFF

 Massage 2 tbsp of fresh lemon juice on hair and rinse out with water. Stir 1tsp of fresh lemon juice into 1 cup of water and rinse hair with it. Do it everyday tills there&#x2019;s no more dandruff.

 LEMON FOR HAIR GROWTH

 Mix 1/4 cup of fresh coconut water with 1 tbsp of lemon juice. Apply and massage on scalp for 5mins.

 LEMON FOR SKIN

- Get a slice of lemon. Squeeze directly on face to clear acne and black spots.
- Mix fresh lemon juice in bath water to deodorize the body.
- Rub lemon on spots like the knee,elbow, heels and palms to make them softer.

 Let&#x2019;s try this out and send in testimonies and complains.

 I&#x2019;m on it too?
