## Gracefully Broken by Tasha Cobbs Lyrics

[Intro]
 God will break you to position
 He will break you to promote you
 And break you to put you in your right place
 But when He breaks you He doesn&#x2019;t hurt you, He doesn&#x2019;t
 When He breaks you He does it with; grace
 Anybody been gracefully broken?
 Thank You, Lord, thank You
 So Father tonight, we&#x2019;re broken before You
 Thank You for handling us with grace
 Just lift your worship right there in this moment

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
 Take all I have in these hands
 And multiply, God, all that I am
 And find my heart on the altar again
 Set me on fire, set me on fire
 Take all I have in these hands
 And multiply, God, all that I am
 And find my heart on the altar again
 Set me on fire, set me on fire

[Chorus]
 Here I am, God
 Arms wide open
 Pouring out my life
 Gracefully broken

[Verse 2]
 My heart stands in awe of Your name
 Your mighty love stands strong to the end
 You will fulfill Your purpose in me
 You won&#x2019;t forsake me, You will be with me

[Chorus]
 Here I am, God
 Arms wide open
 Pouring out my life
 Gracefully broken
 Here I am, God
 Arms wide open
 Pouring out my life
 Gracefully broken

[Bridge 1]
 All to Jesus now
 All to Jesus now
 I&#x2019;m holding nothing back
 Holding nothing back
 I surrender (I surrender)
 Y&#x2019;all throw your hands up and sing I surrender (I surrender)
 Say I surrender (I surrender)
 All that I am, I surrender (I surrender)
 Have Your way, use me Lord, I surrender (I surrender)
 Do Your will, it&#x2019;s all Your way, I surrender (I surrender)
 Use my life for Your glory, say I surrender all (I surrender)
 You want to tell [Him?] right where you are (I surrender)

[Bridge 2]
 (Oh) Your power at work in me
 (Oh) I&#x2019;m broken gracefully
 (Oh) I&#x2019;m strong when I am weak
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I will be free
 (Oh, ooh-oh) Your power at work in me
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I&#x2019;m broken gracefully
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I&#x2019;m strong when I am weak
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I will be free
 (Oh, ooh-oh) Your power at work in me
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I&#x2019;m broken gracefully
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I&#x2019;m strong when I am weak
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I will be free
 (Oh, ooh-oh) Your power at work in me
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I&#x2019;m broken gracefully
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I&#x2019;m strong, I&#x2019;m strong
 (Oh, ooh-oh) I will be free

[Chorus]
 Here I am, God
 Arms wide open
 Pouring out my life
 Gracefully broken
