I am sick and tired of being sick and tired of inconsiderate smelly folks. For me to be tired of you, you have to be inconsiderate.

The other day I spoke about this on Instagram, one babe came out to say that it is no one&#x2019;s fault they are smelling. She probably smells too and I must be really honest, I have nothing against those who smell.

I have an issue with those who smell and are inconsiderate at the same time.

You know deep down in your heart that you stink and you still want to raise your hands. Why? So that I can finally choke?

You know you smell and you still want to rub your body against mine in the bus, you close in on me as if to kiss me, you want to hug me, you do all sorts despite the ooze?

Or is it possible those who smell are not self-aware enough to know that they stink?

You really don&#x2019;t have to use deodorants if your church is against it. How about powder on your armpits, nice soap baths or just safely tucking your armpits away from my nose? Just saying.

Hashtag sighs!

I literally don&#x2019;t know how to end this one.
