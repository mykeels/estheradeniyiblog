Ogbono soup is also known as **Ogbolo soup or apon**, in Yoruba. Ogbono&#x2019;s soup nutritional value is immense. It was one of the soups I hated growing up tho&#x2019;. Mumsi would make this soup and for the umpteenth time, we would scream all sorts of negativity at the soup and its accompanying solid and even the animals inside. Oh, we hated it.

I want to guess it was because mumsi cooked it like the typical Yoruba woman would. It was mostly too plain for our liking. I, personally, did not like that it was too thick. Mumsi&#x2019;s ogbono soup draws like, jeez. We rarely make it at home anymore tho&#x2019;. I feel we have forgotten all there is to this draw soup at home now, can&#x2019;t say why.

That easy! Ogbono is one of the easiest draw soups to cook. You can even go minimalist on your soup accessories, depending on how much money you have. I used to cook ogbono in school when I was broke because all I needed to get was the seeds, grind and then add pepper, seasoning and palm oil.

I have a friend who would mix everything together, pour into the pot and just leave to simmer. Guys, it would turn out so nice too. You won&#x2019;t believe it. This soup, as long as you have the seeds is the go to, staple soup for students who don&#x2019;t want to go through too much of stress cooking in school.
