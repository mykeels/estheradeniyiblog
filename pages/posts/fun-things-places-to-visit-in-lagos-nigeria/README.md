Whether you are a long-standing Lagosian or you are coming into town for the first time, this list is everything you need to catch fun in Lagos.

Trust this one to be as useful, comprehensive and as informative for you.

## Visit the beach
![Atican beach resort](images\Atican-beach.jpg)Photo via: allmyview.com
Lagos beaches are one of the most popular places to visit in Lagos. This looks to me like one of the options that quickly jumps out at people who want to do fun things in the city.

So strap up your beach sandals, we are going for some sea side fun.

If you don&#x2019;t have an idea of where to start from or what set of beaches to explore, don&#x2019;t worry, I have got you covered.

## Go kayaking

**Kayaking in Lagos** is becoming popular by the day. A lot of people are beginning to overcome their fear of the sea.

![Freedom park, Lagos](images\freedom-park-lagos-.jpg)Photo credit: cometonigeria.com
One of the [most popular conservation centres in Lagos Lekki conservation centre.](https://estheradeniyi.com/lekki-conservation-centre/) People literally go to this spot for weekend fun and mini vacations.

You should have seen LCC during the holidays. Why wouldn&#x2019;t they though?

Lekki conservation centre is where we have the **longest canopy walk in Africa**. You don&#x2019;t even want to visit and come back without climbing.

Well, this may have a lot to do with your pocket but if you don&#x2019;t mind, shopping in Lagos is a whole new experience for you. With the inexhaustible list of shopping malls in Lagos, trust that you are going to have fun walking around.

If you are not going to spend, how about window shopping? Thankfully, you have a lot to window shop for in Lagos shopping spots.

It would make the most sense to go with a friend or a group of people if you don&#x2019;t want to miss out on the fun.

## Visit the cinema

![Lagos cinemas, cinemas in Lagos](images\VISIT-THE-CINEMA.jpg)

The cinema happens to be top of my **favorite fun spots in Lagos**. It&#x2019;s no wonder really, I kind of dig into [movies](https://estheradeniyi.com/category/movies/) a lot.

It&#x2019;s much more relaxing for me when I go alone. You can go alone or with people, your choice.

Check out movies you want to see before visiting or go for an impromptu movie date with someone or with yourself.

**A list of popular cinemas in Lagos**

- [Ozone cinemas](https://estheradeniyi.com/ozone-cinemas-yaba/)
- Genesis cinemas
- Silverbird Cinemas
- Filmhouse cinemas

## Take a train

![train in Lagos](images\train-in-lagos.jpg)

I bet this would be fun. Commuting in a train within Lagos is a whole new experience on its own.

You can try to find out the closest/nearest train station from where you are and board it just for fun to somewhere else.

Because train rides are not the best of rides to experience all by yourself, you might want to go with people. Remember to take pictures if this is your first time.

A much less daring fun is to board the [yellow Lagos danfo buses](https://estheradeniyi.com/lagos-danfo-buses/) for a whole day. No Taxify, Uber or personal car ride. Please note that this kind of Lagos fun is for the restless and courageous.

## Go to the market

![Yaba-Market](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/&#x2022;-Yaba-Market.jpg)

Well, not everytime online shopping. Lagos markets are a totally different world. It is in Lagos markets you understand what your mum means by Lagos sharpness.

You will learn how to haggle, negotiate and be your own security guard all at the same time. Additional goodness is that you might find really good deals you never ever thought of.

One thing about Lagos markets, large or small is how much of impromptu buying goes on. That in itself is so much fun.

I would like to mention that computer village is that one market you don&#x2019;t want to forget to enter.

It is a whole new experience and dimension on its own. If you can do crowd, don&#x2019;t mind noise and are up for some haggling and market insults, **visit computer village**. That may be the fun you need for an evening.

**Here is a brief list of popular markets in Lagos to try**

- Alaba international market
- Balogun Market
- Bar Beach Market
- Lekki Market
- Mushin market
- Oyingbo Market
- Mile 12 Market
- Oshodi Market
- Rauf Aregbesola Market
- T&#xE9;j&#xFA;osh&#xF3; Market
- Computer Village
- Ekpe Fish Market
- Ikotun Market
- Idumota Market
- Isale Eko Market
- Jankarra Market
- Ladipo Market
- Yaba market

## Visit University of Lagos

![University of Lagos](images\UNILAG.jpg)

You don&#x2019;t want to be in Lagos and not visit the popular **UNILAG in Akoka**. A one time visit is enough.

Try to do this when the students are in session. If you have the luxury of time and favorable distance away, you might want to visit the University of Lagos in the night.

This is a totally different world on its own. The kind of energy, food choices, slangs, culture, and shenanigans of the campus is a good place to start for some Lagos fun.

Hopefully, you get to make a few random friends. Don&#x2019;t forget to take pictures.

A brief guide is in order especially if you are visiting for the first time. Here are some interesting things to do in Unilag: visit the radio station (Unilag 103.1 fm), check out the lagoon front, sit and gist at the Senate love garden, visit Adetokunbo Sofoluwe park, go for a morning/evening run, check out the coffee shop.

## Attend Lagos Owambe

![Lagos Owambe](images\Lagos-Owambe.jpg)

**Lagos owambes** are a must attend. If you never ever check out anything or anywhere in Lagos, please make sure to attend an owambe in Lagos.

If you want to be fully involved and are up for it, buy the aso ebi and give to a good tailor. Have yourself some Lagos party fun.

A note of warning: owambes are better attended in groups. You want to have people to take your pictures, tease you and do event gossip with.

This one thing you would never miss at Lagos owambes, Yoruba demons. And of course, slay queens. Lagos owambes are a whole new experience, trust me.

## Visit the museum and other cultural centers

The Nike art gallery stands out among a few. The National Museum in Lagos is also one nice place to visit.

Others to check are

- Kalakuta museum
- Mindscapes children museum
- Didi museum
- Terra Kulture
- Nimbus gallery
- Rele gallery
