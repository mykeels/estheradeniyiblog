**Entrepreneurship**, to me, doesn&#x2019;t come easy as it spells. It doesn&#x2019;t even spell easily at all, just look at clusters of letters, aha. Being an online entrepreneur is enough proof to anyone. So, I have loads and loads of fun learning, unlearning, picking up new skills and becoming the best version of myself in order to make things work.

However, I do not deny that to get here and be in the process of climbing higher, I have had to and I still watch tons of people speak on entrepreneurship. I read lots of articles from entrepreneurs who are not just theoretical but have tried and are succeeding in entrepreneurship.

One thing I have learned a long time ago is to stop listening to people who read a lot. I want to see what you have done in that aspect if I must listen to what you have to say. TED talks have been very instrumental in my entrepreneurship journey, I must confess.

I am going to share** 5 of the best TED talks for entrepreneurs** so far. These TED talks have immensely impacted me and one or two of them have been the major game changer for me; in the way I reason, process and make really serious decisions in my business.

## **What they don&#x2019;t tell you about entrepreneurship | Mark Leruste | TEDxCardiff**

Mark bares the harsh reality of being an entrepreneur and skillfully exposes the behind the scenes of what appears to be a perfect life. Oh, and [he wakes up 5 AM every day](https://estheradeniyi.com/waking-up-at-5-am-literally-changed-my-life/) too!

## **What makes an entrepreneur? | Sahar Hashemi | TEDxYouth@Bath**

All of us have the entrepreneur within, we have to reach down deep to find it and bring it up to the surface. This is one of the very important lessons I picked from this.

## **Why Most Entrepreneurs Are Slowly Killing Themselves | Phil Drolet | TEDxMileHigh**

In this talk, Phil explains what it normally takes to be successful and how it has its dark sides. He talks about looking at the whole picture before we start to think of emulating some certain kind of entrepreneurs, perhaps, they are slowly killing themselves.

## **Entrepreneurship: A journey in self-discovery | Ameera Shah | TEDxJanpath**

This is one of my favorite TED Talks for entrepreneurs and this is because I can relate to this as a woman. This one asset that we can hold on to, confidence, will cause a positive change in our entrepreneurship journey.

## **How the entrepreneurial mindset can change you: Henrik Scheel at TEDxSacramento**

Henrik talks about entrepreneurship from the mindset perspective.

## Bonus: The real reason female entrepreneurs get less funding | Dana Kanze
