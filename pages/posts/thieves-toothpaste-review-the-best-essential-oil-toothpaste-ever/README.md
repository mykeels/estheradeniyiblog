**Thieves Toothpaste** is currently my fav now and I do not say this because I am doing a review, which is mostly going to be positive. I say this because my review might be one of the best toothpaste reviews you might ever read on Thieves as I share every single thing I know about it.

There are so many reasons a lot of people are considering a switch from chemicals in their mouths to natural, organic substitutes. In this case, we are referring to essential oil kinds of toothpaste.

Toothpaste, no matter how careful you are, will still find a way to seep into your body system. In minute quantities, maybe not an issue but in substantial amounts, oh well.

Thieves toothpaste is an essential oil toothpaste that comes in 3 different varieties &#x2013; Thieves Ultra toothpaste, Thieves Aromabright toothpaste, and Thieves Dentarome Plus toothpaste.

The variety of Thieves (essential oil) toothpaste I use is **Thieves Aromabright toothpaste** and that is so far, the only one I have ever used for now. I have been using this for more than a week now and I think a review is due. Really, three days are all you need to review a product that&#x2019;s working well or not.

## Thieves aromabright toothpaste ingredients

Water, Calcium carbonate, Cocos nucifera (Coconut) oil, Sodium bicarbonate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Xylitol, Xanthum gum, Mentha piperita&#x2020; (Peppermint) oil, Mentha spicata&#x2020; (Spearmint) leaf oil, Eugenia caryophyllus (Clove) bud oil, Ocotea quixos&#x2020; (Ocotea) leaf oil, Cinnamomum verum&#x2020; (Cinnamon) Bark oil, Citrus limon&#x2020; (Lemon) peel oil, Eucalyptus Radiata&#x2020; leaf oil, Rosmarinus officinalis&#x2020; (Rosemary) leaf oil, Stevia rebaudiana leaf extract, Lecithin (Sunflower).

## Why I am so in love with Thieves aromabright toothpaste

**1. It is safe**

Of course, it is safe, it is very safe! The thieves toothpaste is a combination of ingredients that are very natural and organic. There are no artificial colours, artificial sweeteners, fluoride, DEA, Triclosan or SLS like the other kinds of toothpaste.

This is not a license to abuse this and swallow at will but I am more rest assured knowing that I have done one more thing right &#x2013; switched chemicals for natural.

**2. It leaves a heavenly aftertaste in the mouth**

So, this is very subjective, I think, and it is because, my sister used this for the first time, spat it out immediately, washed her mouth thoroughly, used another toothpaste and ate a lot of things to get rid of the taste and eventual aftertaste.

She was very pissed, lol. The case was the opposite for me. I really loved the taste and aftertaste. Since this is something that is not generally welcome, you might want to try out a friend&#x2019;s or just go all in to try if you can afford to.

**3. It naturally whitens the teeth**

I guess I didn&#x2019;t start with this because I might be so excited that I might end up closing this review on just this one point. Thieves aromabright toothpaste dazed me here, so unexpected. After the third day of using this toothpaste, my teeth began to brighten up.

This is not even a reason or result I ever considered so when I began to notice the change, it pleased me a lot. Even the stains of long ago are gradually disappearing. It has made me all the more confident to smile wider. Such a blessing the paste has been for me in this regard.

In addition, a lot of people claim that [adding orange essential oil to Thieves toothpaste](http://thejoyfuloilers.com/2016/09/how-to-whiten-your-teeth-naturally-with-thieves-toothpaste/) makes your teeth whiten really well. You might want to give this a try. It seems like very popular opinion.

So many of the so-called chemical toothpaste promise to whiten and stuff but they do not do anything of such in the end and it is so annoying

**4. The minty flavour is so refreshing**

I love the flavour it comes with. It smells so nice and refreshing. You can almost eat it! I think this allows for fun brush time.

**5. The dispensing from the tube is very awesome.**

The way it nicely dispenses into my toothbrush is very intentional. A squeeze and you have just the right amount sitting nicely on your brush.

## What I do not like about Thieves aromabright toothpaste

**1. It doesn&#x2019;t foam**

So, when I watch foreign movies, I watch how they have to brush their teeth and spit out nothing but small liquid. It gets me confused every time, like, is it that the white man&#x2019;s toothpaste is that foamless? When I tried out Thieves toothpaste, I realized that oh, well, I am on to the white man&#x2019;s kind of toothpaste, lol! I am not sure if this is a white man&#x2019;s thing or just an essential oil toothpaste thing.

This isn&#x2019;t really a big problem as it were because I might just begin to start getting used to using toothpaste that does not foam. Really, why do we need toothpaste to foam tho? I guess it just gives us that squeaky clean feeling.

So, maybe the fact that it doesn&#x2019;t foam like all the kinds of toothpaste I am used to may be a little bit off but I may also have to start welcoming brush time change.

**2. Aftertaste might be uncomfortable after a while**

Remember, I like the flavour and the aftertaste but what I mean here is that after a while, if I do not get to eat anything, the lingering flavour stuck in my mouth is quite uncomfortable.

## What else I would love to try

Thieves mouthwash is that product I would love to give a try in combination with the Thieves toothpaste.

## In conclusion:

Even if you never go for Thieves toothpaste, I would advise that you consider trying an **essential oil toothpaste** for real. This might be one of the best lifestyle changes you will ever make in your life, no kidding.
