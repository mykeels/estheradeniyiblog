I have been **traveling from Lagos to Ilorin by road** for more than 8 years now. It&#x2019;s so funny I have never thought to document my road travel for once. I attended [the University of Ilorin](https://estheradeniyi.com/unilorin-courses-school-fees-admission/) for my undergraduate and postgraduate studies.

It is why I am on this route very frequently. I am currently on a Lagos to Ilorin road travel again today. If you didn&#x2019;t know, I relocated from Lagos to Ilorin some months back. I still want to talk about this someday. Most importantly, what made me make the move.

While I was on the internet today, I thought it would be wise to write about my road travel from Lagos to Ilorin today and possibly answer the most frequently asked questions.

## Mufsuf Motors (Lagos to Ilorin)

So I decided to use **Mufsuf Motors** for my Lagos to Ilorin travel. There are so many other transportation companies in Lagos to use for road travel to Ilorin. I will share some of them with you in the Frequently Asked Questions segment.

I chose Mufsuf Motors because it seemed to be convenient for me as regards the last stop. **Mufsuf Motors in Ilorin** has its park at Oke Odo, Tanke, right beside Item 7.

I stay very close to Oke Odo, Tanke, so having that as the last stop is just very convenient. Students of the University of Ilorin too would rather use this transportation line.

The problem with Mufsuf Motors, however, is that their vehicles are very bad. I know that many of the vehicles used for road transportation by all of them from Lagos to Ilorin and vice versa are very bad, to be honest. I probably expect more from Mufsuf Motors because it is pretty new around here.
![Mufsuf motors, Ilorin, Ilorin to Lagos](images\Lagos-to-Ilorin-bus-travel-with-Mufsuf-motors-2.png)Bad seat interior for a transport company
My seat partner was sharing really touching tales of how she has never made it to Ilorin in their buses because it either stops on the road or they drop them at Osogbo and ask them to find their way.

We all thought she was exaggerating until it was time to start our journey. The bus was pushed for a kick-start for more than 30 seconds. There was a little hassle before the Mufsuf vehicle would start.

The bus experienced a lot of troubles on the way. It is so sad that in Nigeria we don&#x2019;t have many choices as such because when you move to the next company, it is the same story.

I really don&#x2019;t know the difference between the general motor parks and the transportation companies.

This is a vehicle we were supposed to travel in from Lagos to Ilorin! Not intrastate travel, interstate! My seat partner kept cussing at the drivers with threats of how it&#x2019;s going to be hell for them if they never get to Ilorin like always. Apparently, when they drop you off at anywhere their buses stop, you are left to find your way. No refund, no transport fare.

## Lagos to Ilorin road travel experience

This particular journey wasn&#x2019;t too good, I must confess. I have had better road travels. With the bad shape of the bus, and how tight and very cramped it is, you bet, it was a bad experience. The worst part of it all was during the stop. Four Muslim men went away for such a long time. They went to say prayers.
![](images\Lagos-to-Ilorin-bus-travel-with-Mufsuf-motors-1.png)Given that they charged these passengers for their load, I expected a better arrangement. There was practically nowhere for people to stretch their legs. Mufsuf is a horrible transport company
I was amazed! I could not believe it. These four guys went away for more than 20 minutes. We didn&#x2019;t seem to know where the mosque was. I personally felt taken advantage of. They were Alfas probably going to a convention in Ilorin together.

## Major stop at Oyo

During your Lagos to Ilorin or Ilorin to Lagos travel, there is usually a major stop at Oyo or Ibadan.

This is when you can take a piss or a shit lol. There is a very popular public toilet. To use it, you pay 20 Naira only. It is pretty neat. You will also find constantly filled water bottles for you to use after you are done with your business.

You can also buy anything from the roadside. Traders will come to the parked buses during the stop to sell all sorts of stuff Cooked corn, akara, bread, asala, dodo ikire, wara, fruits in season, groundnuts, chin chin, fried unripe plantain, snacks (egg roll, doughnuts, etc.), cooked eggs (3 for 100 Naira), bottled water and soft drinks.

There are also restaurants where you can buy cooked rice, beans and swallow foods of all kinds. Sometimes, drivers are not patient for you to go into a restaurant to eat but it&#x2019;s worthy of note.

For those of you who like to buy things for your family, you can get kulikuli, sliced bread, keg palm oil, and vegetable oil.
