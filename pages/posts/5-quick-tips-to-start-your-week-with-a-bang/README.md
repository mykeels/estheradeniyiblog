A friend of mine just finished his vacation and lamentations poured in. It was a justified work resumption sadness, you would feel so if you listened too. There is no immediate alternative for now so you really have to use what you have until you can get to where you want.

### 1. Do a weekly clear&#xA0;

As soon as you are on your desk, clear up stuff from last week. Your weekly clear should include files on your desktop, images, and documents that you downloaded to your system. Have a separate folder and name it &#x2018;Weekly clear&#x2019;. Dump them all in. Clear your desk and have a space breather.

### 2. Start off with a weekly plan

If you are going to start off your week with a bang, you will need to get a good planner. Write down your goals for the week. You need some clarity. List them one by one and begin to tick off what you have done so far. Writing and ticking off gives you a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.

You finally feel you are doing something worthwhile. Instead of running around worrying and doing nothing, actually, do something by having a plan.

### 3. Easy, baby

Take this one step at a time. There is usually one hell of a mad rush on Mondays. It&#x2019;s not real, it&#x2019;s just a feeling. Get over that feeling and breathe slowly. Do not think about all you have to do for the whole week in just one second.

Take this gradually. Complete a task and then move on to the next and to the next, until you are done. Don&#x2019;t overwork your brain before you overwork your body.

### 4. Wake up an hour earlier

If you are going to start your week right, you need to get into the mood. Wake up an hour or 30 minutes earlier to meditate. You are not to worry about how the week is going to look like, you are to meditate. You can do this on Sunday night too.

You can then have an overview of how you want to accomplish the week&#x2019;s task. The faster you get into the work groove, the better. Just do that on your own terms. Waking up late and rushing to meet up with Monday can ruin your whole week!

When you are satisfactorily dressed, it gives you the right start. The idea is to start your week right so get one of your best work clothes and probably, wear your new pair of footwear today.
