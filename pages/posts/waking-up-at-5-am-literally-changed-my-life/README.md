No, this is not another unnecessarily exaggerated post, **waking up at 5 AM** was the game changer for me and this started from when I had no single idea of what this would do for me.

Waking up at 5 AM was a family tradition as we would all have to converge for morning devotion. I thoroughly disliked it. I would get to school and know that many of my friends at my age were allowed to wake up by 6 &#x2013; 7 AM.

Waking up at 5 AM made me feel slightly abused as a child. I thought it was so unfair to make me wake up when I still felt sleepy or wanted to rest some more. Ever heard? Early morning sleep is the sweetest!

Don&#x2019;t blame me, I didn&#x2019;t know that it was [going to be one of the best self-care moves of all time.](https://estheradeniyi.com/self-care-tips-for-bad-days/)

I mean, I watch as people struggle to wake up early in the morning to reap the benefits of waking up early. Here I am, with a body system that is so accustomed to waking up so early it would kickstart at around 5 AM.

It doesn&#x2019;t even matter when I slept, my body clock wakes me up that early. I then decide if I wanted to get up or go back to rest some more. This depends on what day of the week it is and what I have in view for the rest of the day.

Waking up early during my childhood was compulsory but as soon as I gained my freedom, a.k.a moved to the University, I was responsible for either keeping up the tradition or just discarding it altogether.

I am happy I kept it. I will share with you some of the **benefits of waking up at 5 AM** and ways you can make it easier for you to wake up that early.

## Benefits of waking up at 5 AM

***Pin this!***

**You have more time on your hands**

So, I used to live in rush hour city and trust me, the way we rushed for everything was insane. We rushed to jump buses, rushed to work, rushed breakfast. It was always a rat race. Like we were being pursued or something.

Waking up at 5 AM makes it very easy to plan your life. I mean, while the world is rushing to make breakfast, you are already done with that and at a much more relaxed pace too.

**Exercise is more enjoyable**

Have you seen Lionheart? Such a great movie. I particularly loved the early morning scenes where she was seen to wake up at 5 AM to prepare for a morning run. Exercise comes with a lot of reinvigoration and this jumpstarts a highly productive day.

**Quiet time is very easy to observe**

Because of the hustle and bustle of living and surviving (or thriving) generally, it can be very difficult to maintain a great relationship with God.

Waking up at 5 AM gives me the space to tune in to what God has to say. Also, because of the peace and quiet of the environment, it is very easy to meditate and hear your thoughts and what God has to say.

**The day starts off fresh**

This time is the best time for ideas to be birthed and freshly served. The world is quiet, the weather is cool and the air smells so fresh. Your energy is out of this world and you are so ready to face the day with all of this good energy.

**Self-discipline**

There are so many ways to train yourself to discipline, **waking up early in the morning** is one of them. To imbibe a culture of discipline you will have to start from what you can control.

Waking up at 5 AM is a good place to learn discipline, practice restraint and imbibe self-control. You will be surprised at how this will positively affect other areas of your life.

## How to wake up at 5 AM and not feel tired

So, I get it, not everyone was raised in a home that made waking up very early that compulsory. I also know that I might not properly understand what it means to learn this from scratch way along in life.

I have however watched friends who made this into a habit and I can say I learned one or two things from their processes. These, I will be sharing with you. Hopefully, you can adapt some of these into your lifestyle and begin to make some changes as necessary. Trust me, this is going to be one of the most incredible lifestyle changes you would be glad you made, [you can check here for some other great lifestyle changes.&#xA0;](https://estheradeniyi.com/5-incredible-lifestyle-changes-for-2019/)

**Go to bed earlier**

Of course, &#x201C;early to bed, early to rise&#x201D;. This really works. Make it a habit to go to bed as early as 10 pm or thereabout so that you can still have a good night&#x2019;s sleep.

Never underestimate a good night&#x2019;s sleep too.&#xA0;So, yeah, you should go to bed earlier to wake up early and still have longer sleep time.

Power down your gadgets and go off Instagram. Oh, by the way, if you are on Instagram, I would love to connect with you in there. It&#x2019;s mostly fun, I promise. Please [click on this link](https://www.instagram.com/estheradeniyisblog/) to find me. I can&#x2019;t wait to meet you!

**Wash your face as soon as you are up**

Washing your face can change it all for you. As soon as you are up, get your face washed. This will make you sharp and ready.

It is also a bad idea to remain on your bed as soon as you are up. You are going to rely on your alarm clock for weeks until your body fully adjusts to waking up early on its own.

**Allow slip-ups**

Yes, allow some slips. What I have come to realize is that as soon as people don&#x2019;t make it up at 5 AM the first day, they conclude, &#x201C;this is not my thing&#x201D;.

No, you should give your body time to adjust to this new change especially if you have been waking up by 7 or 8 AM all your life.

If you mess up a day, do it the next day, wake up at 5 AM. Keep on doing it until you don&#x2019;t have to think about doing it.

**Have an accountability partner**

If you have someone who is also of the same goal as you to wake up early, it greatly helps. It could be your spouse, a parent, a sibling, a colleague or roommate.

If you are a family person, it might greatly help if you make it a family tradition like my family did. Trust me, your kids are going to grumble. I was once them too. I was born into it, yet I grumbled. This time, you are getting grown-ups to adapt; people who weren&#x2019;t even born into it, so be prepared. aha.

If you make it a habit to wake up very early in the morning, so many things about your life will change for good. You will have an increased energy level and an optimistic morning.
