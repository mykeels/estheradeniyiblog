I have been sharing my thoughts on some of the scenes in **The Hate U Give**&#xA0;**Movie** on my [WhatsApp status](https://estheradeniyi.com/only-44-people-can-view-my-whatsapp-status-updates/) and Instagram stories. It&#x2019;s scattered all over and I would love to have them all in a place where I myself can read again.

The last time I did a major lesson round up ([apart from this one on Geostorm](https://estheradeniyi.com/geostorm-2017-movie-review-5-profound/)) was [War Room (2015)](https://estheradeniyi.com/35-lessons-i-picked-from-war-room-2015/). It managed to go viral without credits to me on most of the blogs. It&#x2019;s fine though, there will always be thieves. Yeah, if you did and are reading this one now, I said it.

**The Hate U Give** is such a powerful movie with a powerful story. Ever wonder why I never talk about cinematography and acting in my movie reviews? I just love stories, that&#x2019;s it.

I want to hear a story and enjoy it. It&#x2019;s that simple. Whenever you see me analyzing a movie in-depth, I didn&#x2019;t enjoy the story (most of the time) and I am looking for ways to make up for it.

## The Hate U Give Synopsis

![The Hate U Give](images\The-Hate-U-Give-6.jpg)

Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg) is in between two conflicting worlds, one that is predominantly poor and black and the other, white and wealthy. Her childhood best Friend, Khalil is shot and she happens to be the only witness. Starr struggles with dealing with the loss of her friend, speaking up for him and maintaining the balance between the diversity she is exposed to daily.

## Thoughts and Lessons from The Hate U Give

**Khalil got himself killed!**

![Algee Smith in The Hate U Give](images\the-hate-u-give-algee-smith-ftr.jpg)

I literally couldn&#x2019;t wait to say this. Like I shared on Instagram, when you&#x2019;ve got a chance to save your life use it.

The cop was wrong but so was the situation. That situation was too complex for a white cop to take in all at once. Pulling Khalil over to ask him needless questions was downright terrorism. It was so unfair.

However in life and death situations especially, two wrongs don&#x2019;t make a right.

This was life and death and there was no need for Khalil to brush his hair. That simple.

**Maverick is the example of a father who understands balance**
![Maverick in The Hate U Give](images\Maverick-The-Hate-U-Give-2.jpg)This scene was so emotional for me. What an awful embarrassment the cops put him through. The only crime he committed was standing up for his daughter,
I like men like Maverick. That man had it tough in life, so much that he swore to make life make better sense to his kids. I would love to marry a good father to our children.

With one hand, he introduced and explained the tough black life, with the other he cuddled them softly. That man was a protector and a provider.

**Starr wasn&#x2019;t communicating well with her friends**

![Starr and her friends in the hate u give](images\the-hate-u-give-2.jpg)

So, things became politically right or wrong when Hailey began to react to issues that were happening in the community. That was a white girl trying to form her own values and get a hang of where she&#x2019;s supposed to stand and on whose side she is supposed to be.

She was right! Cops lives matter too. Now, what&#x2019;s dicey here is that she knew nothing to little of what Starr was going through. Starr was supposed to be able to bear the consequences of being mute. She didn&#x2019;t deserve that white girl.

**Khalil remembered to open the door**

![Khalil and starr in the car in The Hate U Give](images\Khalil-and-starr-in-the-car-in-The-Hate-U-Give.jpeg)

So that scene where shots were fired at the party and Khalil had to help Starr get home was one very sweet one for me. I felt so cherished on behalf of Starr.

I don&#x2019;t know how many men remember to do the little stuff even when nothing&#x2019;s up. This dude got her to safety first before going for his door. Of course, Starr reciprocated.

Khalil overdid it in the end. He didn&#x2019;t have to look in to check if she was okay after he was pulled over by the cop. Needless! And Painful!

**Love is a decision**

![Lisa in the hate u give](images\Lisa-in-the-hate-u-give.jpg)

Maverick&#x2019;s mistakes hurt Lisa real bad but she decided that she shared a love that was more than his mistakes. I love the way she took Seven (Perfection) in. He treated that boy like he was her son.

That young dude settled into that family like he was one of them. Only a loving woman can create such an environment. I believe that a woman can dictate the pace at home.

**Boyfriends like Chris are scarce**

![Chris, Starr&apos;s boyfriend](images\Hate-U-Give-Cast.jpg)

It takes a lot for a man to stick around despite a mute girlfriend. Starr wasn&#x2019;t communicating well, remember I said that earlier.

Of all the people to have shoved aside, her boyfriend wasn&#x2019;t to be one of them. That dude was persistently loving.

**Speaking up always comes at a price**

There is always a price for speaking up so you have to decide if you are ready to live with the price or not. Either way, in the end, someone else will speak up. Would it change anything for you to realize that you could have but didn&#x2019;t? Okay, then, speak up

## Favorite Quotes from The Hate U Give

We live in a complicated world.

Violence, brutality. It&#x2019;s the same story, just a different name.

When you&#x2019;re ready to talk, you talk. Don&#x2019;t ever let nobody make you be quiet.

I ain&#x2019;t named you Starr by accident.

I gave you power in your names &#x2026; Starr (Light), Seven (Perfection), Sekani (Joy)

It&#x2019;s about more than just Khalil. It&#x2019;s about black people, poor people, everybody at the bottom.

T.H.U.G.L.I.F.E &#x2013; The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody

**Amandla Stenberg** is so beautiful tho&#x2019;
