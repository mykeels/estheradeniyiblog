###  Verse 1

Have you heard what the Lord has done
 It&#x2019;s amazing! We rejoice
 Glory to God in the highest
 He has brought the dead to life
 And we shine in the dark
 In our mouth He has perfect His praise

### Pre-chorus

Glory hallelujah
 Hallelujah (2x)

### Chorus

Talodabire o
 Kosi o
 There is none like you
 Talodaire
 kosi o
 You raise the dead to life

Have you heard about his work
 That he raised us up in christ
 Oh the fullness of his love
 In the work of the Son
 Now we stand here redeemed, alive and born again
 In our mouth He has perfect His praise

Prechorus
 Glory hallelujah
 Hallelujah (2x)

Chorus
 Talodabire o
 Kosi o
 There is none like you
 Talodaire

 You raise the dead to life

Oh the blind will see
 And the lame will work again
 cos we shine in the light of the things
 You&#x2019;ve done for us
 In Jesus name
 Talodabire (2x)

 Talodabire o
 Kosi o
 There is none like you

Talodabire o
 Kosi o
 There is none like you
 Talodaire

 You raise the dead to life
