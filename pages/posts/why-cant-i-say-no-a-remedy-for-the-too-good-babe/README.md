The following excerpt is that kind of text that you read in season. It came at the right time. It came at the time this discussion is happening between me and many of my friends, individually and as a group.

This image by Jesus and Jollof was the best conversation starter and it opened the floor for very quality conversations around turning down things that cause us to resent people and uncomfortable situations in the end.

This afternoon, while reading &#x201C;Essential Oils&#x201D;, a publication by Young Living, I stumbled on this very beautiful segment of the magazine; Q & A &#x2013; Ask Kendall.

This answers so many of the questions I currently have as regards **saying no without feeling guilty**. For example, &#x201C;how to say no without hurting someone feelings&#x201D; or &#x201C;how to say no at work or even to family&#x201D;

**Please pin this!**

**Question**

*Kendall*,

I secretly dread the holidays every year because I find myself saying &#x201C;yes&#x201D; when I really want to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. My schedule is always jam-packed, leaving me starved for downtime. Between my kids&#x2019; activities and office holiday parties &#x2013; plus family obligations and invitations from friends &#x2013; I get totally overwhelmed this time of the year. How can I say &#x201C;no&#x201D; gracefully without guilt?

-FA LA LA LA FRAZZLED

**Answer**

*Dear Frazzled*,

We say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; when we mean &#x201C;no&#x201D; because we don&#x2019;t want to let people down. But there is someone else you need to remember to be nice to, and that&#x2019;s yourself. If you are feeling overwhelmed and stressed out, just say no.

Saying no gracefully is an art, and it&#x2019;s one you can learn to master. When declining an invitation, don&#x2019;t over explain. Sincerely thank the person for inviting you and say you&#x2019;ll try to make it, then thank them again. It&#x2019;s not necessary to explain why you may not make it.

Another answer might be, &#x201C;Thank you for inviting me, but I have other plans.&#x201D; Even if your plans are to watch episodes of your favorite Netflix series and take a hot bath! Those are your plans, and you owe it to yourself to carve out time for what makes you happy &#x2013; especially when life gets hectic.

While you are taking that hot bath, remember to add a few drops of your favorite essential oils. My favorite blend is Gratitude. With ingredients like Frankincense, Myrrh and Ylang Ylang, this blend evokes emotions like peace and spiritual progress which will help you stay centered amidst the chaos.
