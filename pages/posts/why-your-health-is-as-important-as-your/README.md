I heard of an era when church sisters turned down marriage proposals from brothers because they couldn&#x2019;t handle their poor hygiene. They couldn&#x2019;t believe that God would lead this kind of brothers to them. Okay, let me cut the chase &#x2013; these guys used to abstain from brushing their teeth all in the name of fasting, they mixed colors like a toddler who is just learning how to paint, name it. Yes, say it!&#xA0; Repulsive.

Health they say is the total state of well-being of humans but we seem to have &#x201C;spiritualized&#x201D; this concept. Let us read what the scripture has to say, shall we?

1st Corinthians 6:19 says, &#x201C;What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost&#xA0;which is&#xA0;in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?&#x201D;

It is interesting to know that God wants us to take care of our body. I hope this would comfort my sisters who love their [skincare rituals](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-five-skin-types-and-how-to-care-for/). I need you to understand that it is with your body that you are effective here on earth so there is a level of spirituality in staying healthy. Look at this&#x2026;

1st Timothy 5:23 says,&#xA0; &#x201C;Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach&#x2019;s sake and thine often infirmities.&#x201D;

Apostle Paul was referring to Timothy, a G.O(General Overseer) of the Asian province. Apparently, Timothy had issues with his stomach and taking a little wine helped him to stay healthy for his ministry and family.

Divine healing is a product of faith, food and common sense as we see here. Jesus won&#x2019;t help you brush your teeth, you will. He won&#x2019;t help you eat right either, you will have to.

Your [health is a concern of your faith](https://relevantmagazine.com/life/surprising-links-between-faith-and-health). If you believe that Jesus died for you, you will need to believe that He wants you to eat right, drink right and keep a good hygiene in order to stay healthy. Whenever you fall sick, always remember Faith, Food and Common sense. You can&#x2019;t expect to feel better when you have a cold but you decided not to eat (food), yet you increase the pace of the fan or increase the AC (common sense) and keep on lamenting that you have a cold instead of confessing Christ&#x2019;s defeat over your health on the cross(faith).

Start today. Stop those junks, take your bath, get a good deodorant, train your voice,&#xA0; have a good shave,&#xA0; take care of your dandruff, stay warm, stay away for allergens&#x2026;do all these because God cares about you and about your health.
