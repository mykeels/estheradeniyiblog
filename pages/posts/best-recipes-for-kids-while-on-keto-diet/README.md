Keto diet seems to win our hearts in the 21st century. A lot of people are beginning to follow up this trendy diet method. It has been so effective, that parents started asking if it&#x2019;s good for their kids. Little did they know that a Ketogenic diet was created to help children suffering from epilepsy.

Studies have shown that the ketogenic diet not only helps kids with epilepsy to reduce the seizures but also improves their health. Keto-rich diet works the same on others too.

If you are still not convinced that the Keto diet is child-friendly, you can read more about it on [https://www.ketogenicsupplementreviews.com/blog/keto-for-kids/](https://www.ketogenicsupplementreviews.com/blog/keto-for-kids/). Meanwhile, if you want your child to try the keto diet, you should know some snack recipes that your kid will love.

## Keto pigs in a blanket

A fun snack that&#x2019;s both delicious and doesn&#x2019;t take too long to cook.
 You will need:

&#x25CF; 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese (shredded)
 &#x25CF; 3/4 almond flour
 &#x25CF; 1 egg (large)
 &#x25CF; 1/4 tsp baking soda
 &#x25CF; 1/4 tsp garlic powder and salt
 &#x25CF; 1/2 tsp sesame seeds
 &#x25CF; 4 medium hot dogs

Cut the hot dogs in your preferable quantity. Melt the mozzarella in the microwave. Combine the cheese with egg, flour, and other ingredients. Mix well and roll it into a dough. Split the dough so that it matches the hot dogs. Place the dough balls on parchment paper and give them a flat oval form. Put the hot dogs on the dough and wrap them in a dough blanket. Sprinkle the sesame seeds all over the dough and put them in the oven for 17-20 minutes on 350 degrees.

## Crispy cheddar cauliflower chips

Kids love small [snacks](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/snacking-your-way-to-better-health/) like chips and fries. Why not make a delicious bite-size keto-friendly food for them?

You will need:

&#x25CF; 3 cups cauliflower (shredded)
 &#x25CF; 1 cup cheddar (shredded)
 &#x25CF; 1 egg (large)
 &#x25CF; 1/4 cup cornmeal
 &#x25CF; 1 tsp salt
 &#x25CF; 1/2 tsp ground mustard

Preheat the oven to 400F. Make sure to squeeze all the water out of the cauliflower. Combine the ingredients from the list in a bowl. Give the mixture form of small balls and place them on the baking pan. Bake the mixture for 18-20 minutes.

## Chicken tenders

Chicken is an all-time favorite meat and a keto diet go-to food.
 You will need:

&#x25CF; 200-300 grams of chicken breast
 &#x25CF; 1 cup almond flour
 &#x25CF; 1 tsp salt and pepper
 &#x25CF; 1 egg (large)
 &#x25CF; 1/4 cup heavy cream

Whisk the [egg](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/14/health/eggs-healthy-food-drayer/index.html) and heavy cream in a bowl. Then add salt and pepper. Slice the chicken breasts in your desired form. Add the chicken to the mixture and let it be in there for 10-15 minutes. Take the chicken from the mixture, coat it with almond flour and fry it on a pan (with olive oil or coconut oil).

These three simple recipes might save your day. They are easy, delicious and what&#x2019;s more important kid-friendly. Following a keto diet doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to say no to your favorite food. You just need to find a substitute that&#x2019;s healthier and equally tasty. You&#x2019;ll be glad to implement these dishes in your children&#x2019;s menu.
