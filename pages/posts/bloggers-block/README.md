So, yeah, you know that there are times that I don&#x2019;t even have or know what to blog about. [Remember this post](https://estheradeniyi.com/when-you-dont-feel-like-blogging/)? Sometimes I am embarrassed, other times, I am just frustrated. Like fam, nothing to write? I check my drafts and I am like, none of these items are in my vibes right now, so no.

Blogger&#x2019;s block is real, long and short. And it can be tiring and overwhelming and just not too cool. I mean, you have an audience and you don&#x2019;t have what to say to your audience. Jeez&#x2026;

I have tried a lot of things in the past and while some worked, others failed. In a way, I now have a pattern of a list of things to do when I open my WordPress&#xA0;dashboard and my blogger&#x2019;s memory is totally blocked.

I have a post on [how to never run out of blog ideas here](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-never-run-out-of-blog-post-ideas/) but these tips I am about to share with you now are slightly different. You could also go on to check some more ideas to help you get out of your Blogger&#x2019;s block in that post.

**I go out and have experiences**

Here&#x2019;s is what I have come to realize as a Writer/Blogger, the more experiences we have, the more things we have to talk about, muse about and ponder on. So when I switch things up, change my environment and leave my comfort zone, my Blogger memory is stimulated.

I am a stay-at-home kind of girl. I am very comfortable with staying in my comfort zone, which is working on my laptop so much that I forget that the world is actually happening.

It is therefore&#xA0;not uncommon to run out of ideas and blog post inspiration. And so, because&#xA0;this has worked for me, I simply ask Bloggers who have an issue with Blogger&#x2019;s block to try to go out and create memories.

**I practice Free Writing**

Free-writing is simply freestyling or forcing yourself to write. So, I open my WordPress dashboard and have nothing to say yea, I just close the page and move on to my Google Keep to free write.

I pen what&#x2019;s in my mind at the time. It&#x2019;s amazing how this works so well. Before you know it, really cool ideas begin to form in your head. I am able to dig out something from my free, careless musing and before I know it, it&#x2019;s become a thing.

**I do something different&#xA0;**

So, if for the last 6 months, all I have been doing is writing long posts or a certain kind of posts, I switch things up and do something entirely different.

E.g, I post a video and talk about it. It always works because I have realized that in trying to talk about the video or something, a whole new blog post is formed and I am like, wowzer, all I needed was material?

Another thing you could try is to write lists. E.g [25 Women Quotes to Inspire you](https://estheradeniyi.com/top-25-best-women-quotes-to-inspire-you/), 101 ways to say No. It is sometimes lazy blogging but it helps you to fill in the gap while you try to find yourself.

Have you ever been in the blogger block situation before? I would really love to know how you battled and overcame. What did you do differently?
