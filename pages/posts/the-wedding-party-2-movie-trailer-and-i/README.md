[![The Wedding Party 2 Movie Trailer, Esther Adeniyi,](../pages/posts/the-wedding-party-2-movie-trailer-and-i/images/The-WeddingParty-3--1024x576.jpg)](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-WeddingParty-3--1024x576.jpg)

The Wedding Party 2 (2017) isn&#x2019;t out until December but as expected, the buzz is all over town. We won&#x2019;t quickly forget how deafening the hype of The Wedding Party 1 was.

Funny, however, is that some of my friends are of the opinion that The Wedding Party is over-hyped. The buzz continued several weeks after its release despite. Well, we are on to [The Wedding Party 2](http://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/movies/10-things-we-know-about-the-wedding-party-2-id7444709.html). What are we going to expect?

####  First, watch The Wedding Party 2 Trailer below. Just click play

####  The Wedding Party 2 Cast

 Patience Ozokwor is coming on board? Okay, gimme some handkerchief. This is going to be war! Well, the other stars we hope to see are : Omoni Oboli, Seyi Law, Chigul, Daniella Down, RMD, Ireti Doyle, Ali Baba, EmmaOhMyGod, Ikechukwu the Rapper and Saka. Saka, nitori Oloun.

And our favorites &#x2013; Banky W and Adesua Etomi. I would like to think that their real life romance has helped to heighten the expectancy of The Wedding Party 2.

####  It is going to be more dramatic

 The highlight of this movie is going to be that someone mistakenly [proposed](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/can-you-as-lady-pop-question)? Who makes that kind of mistake? Uhn. And all of a sudden, [there is a wedding](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-much-does-wedding-cost)! Nonso Onwuka (Enyinna Nwigwe) and Deirdre (Daniella Down) will marry. Okay!

So a friend and I were having a general discussion around marriage and we concluded that you see, all these unplanned, awkward, weird marriages might turn out really great. Just saying. This is not an absolute fact but sometimes we don&#x2019;t plan who we fall in love with and in the end it turns out great!

####  I am watching out for Sola Sobowale

 Is it her dance moves or her extroverted nature in The Wedding Party? I could not have enough of her in Part 1. That woman is an handful. When I watched the trailer, my movie self become really expectant.
