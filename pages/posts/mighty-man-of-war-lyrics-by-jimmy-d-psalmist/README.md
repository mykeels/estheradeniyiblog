**Mighty Man of War**
 Lion of Judah
 We bow down and worship You
 Yahweh! Yahweh!
 Come and do what only You can do

You are the God that killeth and also make alive
 You are the lion, yet You are the Lamb of God
 Yahweh! Yahweh!
 Come and do what only You can do
 You are my glory and the lifter of my head
 Demons tremble at the mention of Your Name
 God of thunder, You are the God of fire
 Come and do what only You can do

(Refrain)

You are the father to the fatherless
 You are the the mother to the motherless
 The husband to the widow
 You are help to the helpless
 My healer, You are my deliverer
 Come and do what only You can do
 You are the WayMaker
 You are the mountain mover
 You raise the dead, you make the womb fruitful
 Yahweh! Yahweh!
 Come and do what only You can do

(Refrain)
