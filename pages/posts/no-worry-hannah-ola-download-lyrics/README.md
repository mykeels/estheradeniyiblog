## No worry by Hannah Ola lyrics

From the days of John the Baptist until now

The Kingdom Of heaven suffereth violence

And the violent take it by force

There&#x2019;s no need to worry

At all at all

No need to fear

At all at all
 [x4]

It is a situation [x3]

But no worry I see reason for a celebration

No need for complication

In Jesus Christ there will be jubilation

No need for complication

In Jesus Christ there will be jubilation

It is a situation

But no worry I see reason for a celebration

No need for complication

In Jesus Christ there will be jubilation

Ahan han &#x2026;.

I see a miracle [x3]

Coming to me
 [x2]

Ooh yeah

From the days
