Let&#x2019;s face it, some days just turn out not too good. These bad days can be triggered by memories, someone&#x2019;s attitude toward us or situations that are just beyond our control. On these days self-care is important.

You will have to learn how to look after yourself during your dry times because as a matter of fact, everyone else is busy doing the same. Everyone else is trying to survive or thrive, whichever stage they are in.
