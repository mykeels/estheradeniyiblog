 This is a repost. I was reading my blog archive and I found this extremely useful. I am hoping it will reach more people, especially bloggers this time around.&#xA0;
With the
 rise of blogging as a career, a lot of competition has arisen and it&#x2019;s only
 expected that people want to drive traffic, massive traffic towards their
 blogs. However, in the search of readers, there is something that every blogger
 should never consider losing-online integrity. Let me mention that it is
 possible to lose it before knowing and bitter truth is that redeeming is
 costly. The internet is relationship with different sets of people and like
 relationships, redeeming trust is almost impossible like that. Here are a few
 tips to help you maintain your online integrity as a blogger.

Stay on your lane

 When the
 news of Linda Ikeji buying a house broke the internet, lay men began to see
 other Nigerian bloggers as lazy and not just competent. I personally know a few
 of my blogger friends who ported to reporting news, celebrity gossip and
 entertainment. One grievous mistake they made, however, was that the theme and
 title of their blogs remained the same. Imagine that a hair stylist all of a
 sudden buys a sewing machine and begins to practise tailoring in the same hair
 styling shop. Weird right? That&#x2019;s exactly how weird it is when you do not stay
 on your lane.

 Another
 friend of mine (not a blogger) asked me to go desperate with sourcing for
 traffic. &#x2018;How?&#x2019; I asked. &#x2018;Do what Linda Ikeji too is doing naaaaau. You need to
 start doing these things too&#x2019;, he replied. I couldn&#x2019;t convince him much of the
 havoc that can cause to my blog but I politely explained how gibberish he
 sounded. Moreover, he sounded very Nigerian. (Forgive my plainness; we need
 correct thinking in the country). Please, do not compromise; it can ruin all
 your hard work.

Never copy and paste

 Well well
 well. If you are a blogger who copies and pastes stuff, you don&#x2019;t have to be
 lectured too deeply to know that this is for you. A tech blogger I met some
 time ago on a hot Sunday afternoon on campus confessed to copying and pasting
 and how he knows that it is bad and very inappropriate but &#x2018;I need articles on the
 site because I am looking for traffic o&#x2019;. I shook my head in utter disappointment
 and the realization that moving ahead in the discussion will be a waste of
 time. I would first of all have had to help him debug that &#x2018;copy and paste&#x2019; mentality
 and that was going to take a hell of a time; so I simply walked away from the
 discourse. Don&#x2019;t do that, do not copy and paste because if you do to get
 traffic you will eventually lose it when you are discovered. What exactly is
 the point then?

Man your emotions

 I know that
 this can be difficult for lifestyle and/or personal bloggers because this
 portion of the internet affords you the opportunity to release and have a way
 to channel your frustration. Thing is that while you are boiling hot, a reader
 might just be enjoying a glass of champagne on a water bed. That post of yours
 may become offensive in the long run. Things you wouldn&#x2019;t say assuming you were
 &#x2018;sane&#x2019; might be uttered and that can destroy everything. It can make you appear
 unstable. It&#x2019;s okay to rant but controlling your emotions which can reflect in
 your language is very important. If you are very angry, take some time to cool
 off and write your first post as regards that matter (if you must) on a less
 serious platform, say bbm or your personal Facebook timeline.

Be original

 Every writer
 has a voice and finding it is a very big achievement. Readers can sense it when
 you are trying too hard to write and sound like someone else. This has a way of
 putting people off if you don&#x2019;t know. In addition to putting your readers off
 and losing your space, you will get yourself tired quickly. Trying to talk like
 Jennifer Lopez is exhausting, don&#x2019;t you think? Sooner or later, you lose the
 vibe, will not be able to provide what they want and eventually, it is over.

 So, there
 you go. Any other tips?

 Keep
 blogging!
