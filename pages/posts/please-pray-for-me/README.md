How else was I going to get you to click on this post? No worries, I am fine and this is a click bait.

Not really a click bait. Whatever. I just want to talk about some stuff and hear your thoughts.

When people ask you to pray for them, do you remember to add them in your prayers?

I mean, like, &#x201C;God, I commit Sade into your hands, she is having problems finding the right eyeshadow colour for her birthday makeup&#x201D;.

You know&#x2026;

I have a system that works for me. I will say it in the comments section.

Your turn first, do you remember to put people in your prayers when they ask you to?

**Update**: I wrote this post yesterday and I was really fine. Today has been a struggle, I lost someone today and it&#x2019;s been really difficult to get over it. Please pray for me, really. Thank you.
