It&#x2019;s Saturday&#xA0;and I must say, it&#x2019;s the laziest in months so far. Please tell me what your Saturday looks like in the comments section. I am definitely not the only one still rolling in the sheets.

But I am wondering if it makes sense to quit a job just because you don&#x2019;t like it? And speaking of &#x2018;like&#x2019;, it&#x2019;s such a stressful word. Why so flunctuating? I raise my hands to the fact that it&#x2019;s just a feeling and like every other feeling put together, it fades and intensifies anyhow.

The other day I heard this smooth motivational speaker say something about leaving a job that doesn&#x2019;t make you happy. &#x2018;Here we go again&#x2019; I muttered under my breath. I have nothing against motivational speakers by the way, especially if you are smooth!

So dude&#x2019;s asking me to quit what&#x2019;s giving me the right to walk into a store with Naira prints? Oh boy. I don&#x2019;t know tho, it&#x2019;s cray man!

But it&#x2019;s got me thinking, really. Where is the line? Where do we adjust it and how far can we shift it? Also, what do we mean when we say &#x2018;like&#x2019;? &#x2018;Like&#x2019; as in &#x2018;makes me happy&#x2019; or &#x2018;like&#x2019; as in &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t wait to get to work&#x2019;. Or &#x2018;like&#x2019; as in &#x2018;no one is frustrating me at work and everything seems pretty fine&#x2019;.

Should you really quit a job you don&#x2019;t like? What about the bills, the &#x2018;I am employed&#x2019; badge? What about everything else that has to do with not being non-employed?
