## Elewi Elese by SeunRolls Lyrics

**Intro**: oh oh oh&#xA0; &#xA0;oh oh oh o

**Verse** :

You are God and God alone you are

There&#x2019;s no other God beside you Lord

Heaven and earth bow before your throne

Angels and the elders cast their crowns

**Vamp**:

Anything you say that is what you do

You are God not man that will change his words
 Once you say it you will do it Lord
 So I lift my hands and I raise my voice
 In adoration to your holy name
 My great and mighty king

**Chorus**:

Elewi Elese

Elewi Elese

What you say you will do

That is what you will

oh oh oh oh oh

**Rap**:

For the change in phase you made me go through

Picked me up from the gutter

Place me upon the rock to stand

Now I can see your presence full in my everyday

What more can I say,

Blessings coming in with no delay

Put it on replay, yes this God is mine to claim

No more pain no more shame

All I have is so much gain everyday

Alewilese look just how you tunmise

There&#x2019;s nothing concerning you that mo lefi ogbon mi se

And now I&#x2019;m here to say baba ese

**Vamp**:

Anything you say that is what you do

You are God not man that will change his words

Once you say it you will do it Lord

So I lift my hands and I raise my voice
 In adoration to your holy name
 My great and mighty king

Repeat chorus

Call:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Elewi
 Resp:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Elewi
 Call:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Elese
 Resp:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Elese
 Call:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; What you say
 Resp:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; What you say
 Call:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; You will do
 Resp:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; You will do
 Call:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; That is what
 Resp:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; That is what
 Call:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; You will do
 Resp:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; You will do
