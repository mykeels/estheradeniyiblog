**The Most Toasted Girl | &#x201C;Pray for Me&#x201D; (S1. E2)**

I swear, this is so me. It is so me, like this is the most accurate description of what it feels like to find a husband in Lagos. So, I was sharing with my folks on Whatsapp.

This dude began to argue with me. He said that I look really familiar. I told him I don&#x2019;t know him from Adam and I am 100% sure he doesn&#x2019;t know me too.

Usually. dudes who use this watery pick up line quickly switch to business when you catch on. I mean, something like, &#x201C;okay, so I am busted. Errrr, is it okay I take a spot beside you?&#x201D; Simple!

We will all assume your stupid line was a conversation starter, only that it has become too popular to be taken seriously.

This guy in question, the one dragging familiarity with me, he just kept making a fool of himself. It was so embarrassing to watch. Of course, he was a learner.

I am liking [this new series though](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM2wWHVLpEnXpHGfZTxxxjg). So short but entertaining and accurate too. Below is the Season 1 Episode 1. Watch:

TheNengers just got a new subscriber and fan. I have been so longing for something hot to keep me on my feet after [Skinny Girl in Transit.](https://estheradeniyi.com/tag/skinny-girl-in-transit/) Who missed SGIT? I terribly miss SGIT.
