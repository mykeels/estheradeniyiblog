 Are you watching [Skinny Girl in Transit](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/ndanis-tv-skinny-girl-in-transit-my)? I talk about that web series a lot, I know. It&#x2019;s obviously my favorite for now. So, there is this Fabris of a guy who had had a one night stand with Tiwa some time ago. Unfortunately, events happen and we know that Mide, Tiwa&#x2019;s boyfriend and Fabris know each other quite well. In fact, Fabris is an ex to Mide&#x2019;s sister. Complicated right?

Okay, now things happening suggest a possible problem in Tiwalade (Abimbola Craig) and Mide (Ayoola Ayolola)&#x2019;s relationship. First off, I really do not know why Tiwa is sneaky about this all but let&#x2019;s wait and see.

I have been reading and watching reviews of episodes of [Skinny Girl in Transit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBYN7uU9mpE) as they drop all over social media and this is becoming a serious discussion. I mean, the discussion surrounding your past as regards your present relationship.

Which of your past should you expose in a [relationship](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/the-four-temperaments-in-relationship)? Should you even share your past at all?

Here is my take on this matter.

Your past is in the past. It happened when you were probably more ignorant, less exposed, more reckless etc. You have grown past all of that and your mistakes, even the gory ones are not worth bringing into a present life.

With your partner, except the relationship is going to crumble under the weight of your past, you don&#x2019;t need telling all over. In Tiwa&#x2019;s case, the relationship is going to crumble, I am sure. If it doesn&#x2019;t crumble totally, there is going to be a lot of problems especially because Tiwa is taking so long to reveal this.

Fabris and Tiwa had a one night stand and that was before she met Mide. Obviously, she did not cheat. I think she fears how Mide would look at her; like an indecent person and all of that. I would like to think that actually. Self control matters in life.

So, what are your thoughts about revealing your past to your partner? Would you keep it like that? Would your reveal some, all? Let&#x2019;s discuss in the comments section.&#xA0;
