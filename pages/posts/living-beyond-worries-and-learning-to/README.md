Worry has been one of the major means the enemy uses to make us swerve into unbelief. Worrying is the opposite of Faith. Faith is the evidence of things not seen yet we believe that it shall come to pass. Worrying at times is also the evidence of things not seen yet we are disturbed that it will not come to pass.

We worry about so many things: about the future; the present situation. When we will get a good job, get married and bear children.

We worry so much because of the current economic situation in the country. But the Lord is telling us at this time that we should quit worrying and [learn to trust in him](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/learning-to-completely-trust-in-god?m=1). I used to worry a lot. I worry about when I will graduate, get a good job/be self-employed and the rest but I have seen that worrying only causes depression. So I have quit worrying and I have learnt to live by Faith and not by sight. You can also quit worrying.

Worrying produces fear, depression and unbelief in God&#x2019;s word. We should learn to understand that worrying will not change the current situation. Jesus gave us the understanding of why we should not worry through the scripture &#x201C;And who of you by worrying and being anxious can add one unit of measure (cubit) to his stature or to the span of his life?&#x201D; Matthew 6:27.

Matthew 5:26 talks about why we should not worry as human beings &#x201C;Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father keeps feeding them. Are you not worth much more than they?&#x201D;

Let this consciousness sink into you that &#x201C;If the Birds do not worry, why should I, the Image of God.

At times, it is LACK OF FAITH that makes us worry. See what Matthew 6:30 further said &#x201D; But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and green and tomorrow is tossed into the furnace, will He not much more surely clothe you, O you of little faith?.&#x201D; Friends, let us quit worrying.

He will surely wipe away your tears and mockery. And he will give you double portion of peace and prosperity. Let us quit worrying and START BELIEVING in God&#x2019;s unfailing words.

Has he told you that you will prosper and you are still living in a face to face apartment? Quit worrying. Just make sure you are on the right path. When that worrying spirit comes, take up the Sword of the Spirit and read. His Word is unfailing. &#x201C;Seek out of the book of the Lord and read: not one of these [details of prophecy] shall fail, none shall want and lack her mate [in fulfillment]. For the mouth [of the Lord] has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.&#x201D;(Isaiah 34:16). Keep confessing positively and you will see that the heaviness in your heart will give way for joy.

Arise from that worrisome state and let God fill your heart with the Oil of Joy.Photo credit : [Role Robot&#xA0;](http://www.rolereboot.org/culture-and-politics/details/2016-09-viral-article-talk-women-wearing-headphones-exposes-modern-mans-dangerous-sense-entitlement/)
