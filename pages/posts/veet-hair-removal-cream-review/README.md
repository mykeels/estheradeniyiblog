This blog post however is going to be a **complete review of Veet hair removal cream**. I will talk about using **Veet hair removal cream for underarm**, **how to use the hair removal cream, Veet hair removal cream for legs, how long it takes before there is a regrowth, the smell, the feel, the immediate after effect, how much veet costs, where you can buy this product** and every single thing you need to know about Veet hair removal cream.

## About Veet Hair Removal Cream

Veet hair removal cream is one of the **best hair removal creams in Nigeria**. It is sold internationally and produced by [**Reckitt Benckiser**](https://www.rb.com/offices/nigeria/). Veet does not only have hair removal products in creams, they also have in mousses, waxes and gels. This review is for the hair removal cream product because, that is what I have used so far. Veet hair removal cream is safe to use as far as I know. You have to have a type of skin that isn&#x2019;t compatible with Veet to have it not work well for you.

## Why and How I started using Veet Hair Removal Cream

So, I mentioned earlier, I have always been a hairy person. It&#x2019;s nice to have your natural hair thick and dense on your head. It&#x2019;s so beautiful to have yourself walking around in long, black hair. Oh so nice. You see, when you begin to see hair grow on other parts of your body, you resent hair all of a sudden.

I saw hair begin to grow on my legs, hand and neck and some other parts of my body I feel so awkward mentioning. No, I don&#x2019;t feel awkward mentioning that I have hair in my pubic region, so, it&#x2019;s not my pubic hair I mean. Okay, I am not going to get you imagining my soul, lol.

For my hair and arms, I used to overlook until my friends began to complain. I would feel so uncomfortable when I saw how smooth other people had their arms. I didn&#x2019;t like that I would wear short skirts and not feel comfortable in showing off my smooth legs.

I became very desperate to have clean, smooth skin on my arms and legs. I began to use shaving stick to shave my body hair. I did this for a very long time. I would have a hot bath so that the hair would be soft and easy to take off. Afterwards, I shave with a shaving stick.

I used to feel it harsh even after hot baths. I didn&#x2019;t feel my skin pampered at all. On this blessed day, a university classmate of mine suggested Veet hair removal cream. When she told me of how much Veet hair removal cream costs, I just couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to buy it. How many times would I use this in a month, or in three months?

Compared to shaving sticks, all I had to do was just buy a pack and use one at a time. There were times I even used a shaving stick twice when I had the strength to sterilize and reuse. Truth is that Veet hair removal is a little bit expensive for students on a budget.

Somehow, I brought myself to buy Veet and everything changed for me as regards shaving my body hair. Since the first time I used it, I just made it a point of duty to save for my shaving cream. I have had to switch to Nair once, just out of curiosity. I am not about to bad mouth Nair but it wasn&#x2019;t just for me.

## How does Veet hair removal cream work?

Veet hair removal cream is a&#xA0;**depilatory cream**. It makes your hair come off without stress and painlessly too. What depilatory creams like Veet Hair removal do is that they break down the keratin structure of the body hair. The keratin is the proteins that you have in your hair. Veet contains alkaline chemicals that break down the proteins so that the hair roots will give way and make the hair weak enough to be broken off.

## How to Use Veet Hair Removal Cream

1. You can have your bath or not. I usually don&#x2019;t have my bath before using Veet every time. I usually like to use Veet before having my bath so that I just have my bath altogether. If you want to have your bath, use your normal toilet or soft soap. Rinse with warm water. Dry the area with a towel completely.

2. The Veet hair removal cream usually comes with a spatula in the pack. Squeeze the Veet cream into the back of the spatula. Then, with the spatula, spread the Veet cream on the body part you want to shave.

3. Depending on your skin type, you can leave it on for 3-5 minutes. What you should do if you are using Veet hair removal cream for the first time is to do a **skin patch test**. Just apply a little on a small part of your legs or arms.

In 3 to 5 minutes, you can test the action. It is also important so that you know whether you will react to it or not. If you are using **Veet hair removal sensitive cream** for example, you may have to wait longer.

4. Remove a small portion of Veet and see if your skin hair comes off with the cream. If it does, remove the rest of the Veet from your skin and rinse the remaining product. You can pat dry afterwards. If it does not, try to wait a little longer.

## Veet hair removal cream for underams and armpits

Veet hair removal cream can be used to remove hair on your underarms or armpits. It is also a safe and quicker way to get it done. In as little as 3 minutes, you are good to go. Please don&#x2019;t forget to do a patch test before going all in. When you do a patch test once, you can be sure that your body is safe and okay with Veet hair removal cream.

This is how I do mine. I take out the spatula in the Veet pack, squeeze Veet hair removal cream into it and gradually apply on my armpits. I wait for 3 minutes to 5 minutes depending on which of the Veets I am using. The Veet for sensitive skin takes much longer.

I then remove a little bit of hair to be sure I am done. I afterwards remove the rest of the Veet with the spatula. I then rinse off thoroughly.

After I pat dry with a towel, I like to apply the normal white, baby powder to make my armpits feel cool. I also do this because I cannot apply roll on, deodorant sticks or anything for 2 to 3 days. It&#x2019;s actually advised not to but even if you go on ahead to, you will experience some bad or sharp irritation.

For some people, it takes considerably one month to have to shave again. My own armpit hair grows as fast as in 2 to 3 weeks, no matter the hair removal method I use &#x2013; cream or shaving stick.

I always like to stress that our reactions to all of these substances depend on our biochemistry and total body makeup.

## Veet Hair removal cream side effects

Some people have been known to have very serious allergic reactions on using Veet. Our bodies differ and this is why it is important to listen to them. I, for one have never experienced any side effects as regards allergic reactions but for people who have, they have complained of skin darkening or burns. This is where I say that the patch test is very important.

For people who have **skin darkening as a side effect of Veet**, it is most likely that there was a reaction during and/or after use. If you use veet correctly and are normally not allergic to hair removal creams, you should not have darkening of your skin by Veet.

Before you proceed to add Veet Hair removal cream to that whole body part, test a little and check whether it causes a reaction. A little as itching, pain or strangeness of the skin is enough to give a red light signal.

Some people have also had severe burns, unpleasant redness and painful itching on leaving the Veet Hair removal cream for too long on their bodies. If you have an overly sensitive skin, apart from having to go for Veet Hair removal cream for sensitive skin, it is also very advisable to stick to the time frame it takes to cause the depilatory creams to work.

Another Veet Hair removal cream side effect is the lingering smell. I do not like the smell of Veet. It is so awful. On some days, I feel nothing, on some other days, I just totally detest the smell. All of these hair removal creams smell that way though. It is just because of the ingredients in them.

So, long after shaving, the smell might linger on for a while if you don&#x2019;t know how to take care of that area. I advise that you rinse well, have a warm bath if possible and then apply soft baby cream on that area.

## Can You Use Veet Hair Removal Cream On Your Face?

The good thing about many of these beauty products is how they write precautions and usage. **Veet hair removal cream for face** is very delicate. Veet hair removal cream is best used for body parts that are not as sensitive as the face. The face is way more sensitive than the arms, legs and other parts of the body Veet is recommended for.

If you have to use Veet for your face, I think Veet hair removal for sensitive skin could go and I would say that limits to the neck. I won&#x2019;t actually apply this on my face. Hey, this is a chemical with loads and loads of ingredients you don&#x2019;t even know how they work.

## Can you use Veet hair removal cream on your pubic area?

I would, personally not advise that you use veet hair removal cream on your pubic area. Even veet hair removal for sensitive skin should not be used in your pubic area because veet hair removal was not designed to be used on your pubic area.

You can use Veet hair removal cream around your bikini line. You inner thighs, just below your tummy etc, and maybe a little bit closer to your pubic area. Getting too close to where your genitals are can cause adverse reactions.

Inasmuch as hair removal creams like veet and the rest have become consumer friendly, it is very important to always remember that these hair removal creams are chemicals with a lot of ingredients you probably know nothing about.

I read somewhere, a lady asked on Yahoo answers what to do about the adverse effect of hair removal cream on her intimate areas. She applied it two years ago and for a whole year, she kept on nursing it. Her vagina and vulva burned so bad that she couldn&#x2019;t even pee well.

## Veet Hair Removal Cream Price

Well, this depends on where you buy yours. I buy mine at Justrite at Ota, Nigeria. I do this because I don&#x2019;t want to fall victim of buying **fake veet hair removal cream**. That will be too much of a disaster. It costs 1,000 Naira at stores I buy it from. If there will be variations, it should not exceed 1,500. For ease, maybe while shopping online, you can [buy Veet hair removal cream on Konga](https://www.konga.com/veet-hair-removal-cream-1984584?k_id=palacedaughter)
