 It is worthy to note that the senior Class of 2017 has earned in Scholarship $21,231,383 for their many outstanding accomplishments.

 Speaking on the award, the father of the 18 year old girl, &#xA0;a Law Professor at the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State , Professor Jim Akhere, a former Commissioner, in the defunct Bendel State of Nigeria said with the feat his daughter has performed &#xA0;it &#xA0;will not be far from the truth to label her &#xA0;a genius.

 He said: &#x201C;Am so proud as a father and thankful to God for what my daughter has done. She has made the Country proud. It is commendable &#xA0;that She came out tops in her school, she was the President of the School and won she won &#xA0;11 scholarship to different American Universities &#xA0; She has opted for Columbia University, an Ivory league . &#xA0;I am a law Professor, but I don&#x2019;t think I know as much as my daughter, of whom i &#xA0;am really proud. She debates, sings, acts and she &#xA0;is tops in her academics. I&#x2019;m eternally grateful to the Almighty for the gift of Uwa to humanity.

 While urging Nigerian youths to take their academic pursuits seriously Professor &#xA0;Akhere added that some of the qualities that make for success in life are &#xA0;hard work, and focus. I do believe that there are those who are gifted, and even these will not get anywhere except they work hard because genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.

 The elated academician also urged government to take the education and training of Nigerian youths more seriously, noting that it remain the best legacy any system can bequeath.

 &#x201C;Education is the best and fairest thing that the &#xA0;best of minds can ever have. Any government that does not take education seriously is not helping humanity. When you are young and you are given to life of acquisition of wealth to the detriment of education then there is a problem, knowledge is everything&#x201D; He added.
