This is another way of announcing on the blog that I have
 finally narrowed down my blogging niche to [Blogging](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/search/label/Blogging). If you follow me on
 Facebook and Instagram, you already know. I want to thank you for making the
 transition both possible and very easy on me.

Before I go into this post proper and conclude safely, I
 want to tell you a story.

When I started blogging, I started out as a personal
 Blogger. I talked about myself and my personal experiences. I just wanted a
 safe online haven. I wanted a place to share my thoughts, express myself, teach
 a life lesson or two and find support.

I had a very hard time growing up and my blog served all of
 the purposes I wanted it to. When I began to grow as a Blogger, I realized that
 I could do so many other things with my blog. In 2015, I made the switch to
[lifestyle Blogging](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/what-is-lifestyle-blogging). I should make a blog post on the difference between
 Lifestyle and Personal Blogging.

So, I transitioned into Women Lifestyle Blogging. It was
 great for a while until I felt the need to connect again with my blog readers
 like I used to when I was a personal Blogger. I switched from Women Lifestyle Blogging
 into Personal Lifestyle Blogging.

That also was a beautiful ride, one of my best so far. I
 wrote whatever the heck I wanted to. I was able to connect deeply with my blog
 readers. I made a lot of beautiful relationships. Oh my, my blog is a blessing
 to my entire life, I must say.

Until&#x2026;

People began to yearn so much for my Blogging posts. Of
 course, because it was a personal lifestyle blog and blogging was and is a very
 huge part of my life, I made blogging posts alongside others. Many Bloggers
 began to reach out to me.

If I hadn&#x2019;t posted a post on Blogging in a while, I would
 begin to get emails, Facebook inbox messages and comments on my social media
 handles. This was confirmed by the kind of interaction I got on these posts.

I had already launched the business side of my blogging
 which is blog consultation, design and blog management. And so, I decided. This
 is it! I finally found it. It would make more sense to monetize if I can give
 this kind of value.

I began the switch gradually until I finally announced to my
 friends and followers on social media. Now, this is my own Blogging story and
 it continues, you know. Every step of my blogging career is part of this story.
 I hope to make many more blogging memories.

Oh, well, this is the spark behind this blog post. It&#x2019;s
 obvious where I got the inspiration from &#x2013; my personal blogging story. So,
 should you too narrow down to a blogging niche or not?

### First of, what are the benefits of narrowing down to a
 blogging niche?

#### 1. &#x201C;Everyone is not your customer.&#x201D;&#xA0; -Seth Godin

If you are going to reach your ideal audience, you will need
 to give them what exactly they want. Not everyone will be interested in what
 you have to say. If you can give people exactly what they want, they will
 become your customer and refer someone else.

#### 2. Your bounce rates will reduce

I will give a very simple explanation to those that have
 never heard of bounce rates. If 100 people visit your blog and all of them do
 not read another blog post, they just close your page, you have a 100% bounce
 rate. If none of them leaves until they check other posts, you have a 0% bounce
 rate.

If your blog meets your specific readers&#x2019; needs, there is a
 very high probability of them sticking around.

#### 3. It&#x2019;s very easy to build authority

If you are in a blogging niche, you can easily prove to your
 readers that you know what you talk about. It helps you as a Blogger to
 research and work hard to bring your readers value. Eventually, you are the
 go-to person for a particular subject matter.

#### 4. Your blog is easier to monetize

Because you have been able to build authority as a Blogger
 in a specific niche, it will be very easy to [monetize your blog](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-do-i-earn-money-as-blogger). Creating
 products and services out of a particular blogging niche is easier.

#### 5. Search Engines rank your blog higher

Your search engine optimization brings better results
 because search engines admit to your authority and thereby feed readers your
 blog posts.

Also, think about it, a blog with a low bounce rate, high
 average time on site and more pages per visits sends a signal to search
 engines. It is an indication that your blog is of much value and other users
 will benefit from it.

### So, should you narrow down your blogging niche?

It depends!

You don&#x2019;t necessarily have to narrow down to a specific
 niche if your blog is for example, a personal blog or a personal lifestyle blog
 with [an audience that truly connects with you](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-to-make-people-fall-hopelessly-in).

In this case, what they are interested in is you and how you
 want to relate with them. They would be so passionate and interested in your
 interests enough to share in your world and even tell someone else about you.

Blogging should always be fun and if you feel you are under
 pressure to talk about just one thing you know may wear you out and make you
 lose all of your blogging joy, don&#x2019;t.

If however, you have decided that narrowing down to a
 particular niche is something that you should do, here are some tips to help
 you narrow down without regrets. Trust me, if you make a wrong move, blogging
 might bore you in the nearest future.

### How do you choose a blogging niche for your blog?

#### 1. Consider your audience first

If you have been blogging for a while, chances are that you
 already know what your audience resonates with the most. For me, for example, I
 realized that my blogging posts were creating so much of buzz on my blog.

The truth is that these blogging posts didn&#x2019;t generate the
 most of my blogging traffic but they generated the kind of quality traffic I
 have always wanted. The conversion rates on those posts were so high that I
 began to look into settling into it,

#### 2. How passionate are you about the topic?

It doesn&#x2019;t make sense if you are not very passionate about a
 blogging niche. No matter how profitable it may seem to be, if it&#x2019;s not
 something you can talk about, read about, share for days unending, don&#x2019;t even
 try it.

Choose a blog niche that ticks many of your boxes. Pick a
 topic that you can talk about for hours.

#### 3. How profitable is it?

After ticking the passion box, it&#x2019;s time to look into how
 you can monetize your blogging in future. It&#x2019;s okay if you don&#x2019;t plan to
 generate income from your blog just yet. It is only important that you consider
 and think about your blog long term.

If you can sell something as a result of that niche, market
 a service, collaborate,. etc..why not?

So, are you going to narrow down to a blogging niche or not? Please, let me hear your thoughts in the comments section.
