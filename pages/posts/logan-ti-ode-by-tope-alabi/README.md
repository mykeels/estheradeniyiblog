## Logan Ti Ode by Tope Alabi ft. TY Bello Video

TY Bello wrote &#x201C;I got urgent word from Apostle Obi Pax-Harry to release the songs from our spontaneous worship session with Tope Alabi over Nigeria &#x2026; This urgent message first came from Lanre Olusola .. &#x201C;those songs have to be released NOW!!&#x201D; I was wondering why God would bring these urgent messages in Yoruba language when Nigeria has over 520 different languages.. I knew this wasn&#x2019;t by accident .. we are a SPEAKING nation; each dialect carrying a &#x2018;redemptive purpose&#x2019; as Apostle Obi Pax-Harry put it .

This is just a seed awakening everyone to the power and beauty of our diverse expressions of worship .. Tope Alabi carries a mantle and great depths in using Yoruba language in song ..it was an incredible experience making music with her .. every sentence out of her mouth made us feel like .. this!! is why God crafted this language .. ..LOGAN TI O DE (THE MOMENT HE STEPS IN) .. reminds me of Genesis .. God SAID , Let there be light:AND THERE WAS light.. That&#x2019;s exactly what happens when we release God&#x2019;s word over a situation, our lives and our nation .. .. He steps in. .. Instantly !! And everything aligns with His purpose . Yoruba is a very interesting language, one word can have varying meanings but this is not peculiar to Yoruba. I had fun praying over my life this past week with the word &#x2018;Settled&#x2019;.

Settled means to resolve, to find an answer to. It also means to place or arrange into a desired state. When Tope Alabi sings Logan Ti Ode, La Ye Mi Le To, it means- the moment God shows up..my life becomes meaningful or Settled.. transformed .. set in order .. rearranged.. programmed. one word .. many layers of meaning . In the song, she brings hope and empathy ..It is one thing to go through troubled waters but it hurts more when people define you by your troubles. But God is the one that has put power in his words to rename you and turn everything around IN A HEARTBEAT!.

When God steps into your situation, many times ..He chooses to bypass process as we know it; His very presence can bring instant transformation. This song brings tears to my eyes because it is my personal story and clearly it is sister Tope&#x2019;s too. It is a song of hope, an anthem for anyone who is desperate for an intervention. It brings true relief to know that God is willing and able to bring one your way. The moment he steps in, everything changes, even your name.&#x201D;
