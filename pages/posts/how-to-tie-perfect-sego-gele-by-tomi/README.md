 Many many arewas have issues with tying geles, sego geles especially. We would rather go to a makeup artist or have that very good gele girl among our cliques to help us out. [Tomi&#x2019;s Colour Pavilion](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqyOnhmQ4eQ8km9apDzh7cg) made something for y&#x2019;all.
One thing I noted and kept securely is to never ever cut the sego gele. Just leave it as ridiculously long as it is.

Enjoy:

Ehn wait wait o, don&#x2019;t leave like that na. What do you think about this? Ya gonna try?
