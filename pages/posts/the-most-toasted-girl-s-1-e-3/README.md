## The most toasted girl | &#x201C;Is This Love?&#x201D; (S1.Ep 3)

&#xA0;

So, this episode&#x2026;

Does it ever happen that this guy is looking like the real deal? Like okay o, he is ticking off number 1, number 2, 3, 4 5, ahn ahn, number 9 on your list and the number 10 that he isn&#x2019;t ticking off just destroys the whole 1 to 9.

I once met one fine guy like that in the cinema o. Shey you know I have shares in the movie industry na. All looking peng na. In my mind, I was like, agysbdbdijckncicjccsa.

Dude approached and my head was just doing tinrinrin tinrinrin. He was coming to ask why I was begging for a ticket switch with someone and if we could do the switch. But nna ehn, his first sentence knocked me off! He had a heavy accent. No no no, it is not bad to have it but you can&#x2019;t be too fine and have that type of accent.

My jeeez, I was just counting minutes to enter the cinema theatre. God was so good to me, he wasn&#x2019;t watching the same movie. I for just dey cry for dia!
