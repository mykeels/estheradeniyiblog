Faith is the number one essentiality of our confirmation that we are sons of God. &#x201C;We have been saved by Grace through FAITH.&#x201D; Without faith, we cannot receive anything from God.

Let us take a cursory look at the woman with the issue of blood on how she took that step of faith to get healed.&#xA0;&#xA0;Matthew 9:21-23 &#x201C;And behold, a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment; For she kept saying to herself, If I only touch His garment, I shall be restored to health.&#xA0;Jesus turned around and, seeing her, He said, Take courage, daughter! Your faith has made you well.&#x201D; And at once the woman was restored to health.

Let us analyze the key sentence from this passage: &#x201C;SHE KEPT SAYING TO HERSELF, IF ONLY I TOUCH HIS GARMENT.&#x201D; The woman had been hearing about Jesus&#x2019; healing power but she had not experienced it. But on that fateful day, she saw Jesus. And she said &#x201C;If only I could&#x2026;.&#x201D; That was the first step. She had that arousal of faith from within. I imagine her heart saying &#x201C;hey, don&#x2019;t do that. You stink. People will pursue you away from him. Sit down there!&#x201D; But the woman KEPT SAYING TO HERSELF, IF ONLY I COULD. She did not look at the crowd. Neither did she respond to what her mind might have been saying to her.

Do you know that many of us have been in that kind of situation and we might have tried to give up due to influx of ill advises from our heart and people. Learn from this woman, &#x201C;she kept saying to herself, if I could.&#x201D; Let me tell you this: Once you believe, you&#xA0;have to speak! 2 Corinthians 4:13 makes this clear as well, &#x201C;We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.&#x201D; We believe, therefore we speak!&#x201D;

Keep saying it. Let the word of faith keep coming from your mouth. Never look at the big problems. Speak Faith enabling words.

Wow! Another thing that baffled me was how that woman knew that if she could touch the helm of his garment she would be healed.

And the woman was steered by that confession she made and she meandered her way through the crowd and TOUCHED the garment. And Jesus looked back and said &#x201C;woman your faith has made you whole.&#x201D; Jesus searched deep into her heart and saw that it was faith at work in her.

This is what we need: FAITH. For 12 years, she had wasted money on drugs. She might have even collected loan from banks (if there was any at that time) but on that day, her sorrow was turned to joy. What is the situation you are facing and it seems as though it will take eternity for you to obtain it? Friend, never give up. God knows about it. He might just be testing your faith. But don&#x2019;t stop confessing the word. Ha! There is power in confession. And don&#x2019;t sit; take that bold step of faith.&#xA0;&#xA0;David spoke those words of faith when he met Goliath and he took that famous step and ran towards Goliath; slinging a stone.

It doesn&#x2019;t matter what you are passing through, as long as you believe, keep confessing those words of faith. Rise to action and you will see that you will be victorious. &#x201C;&#x2026;..this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our FAITH.&#x201D; Yes you CAN. You can conquer those barriers. You can break through from that bondage. Only believe and speak what you believe.
