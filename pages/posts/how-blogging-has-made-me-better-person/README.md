Whatever we are involved in has to add something positive to our lives and if it isn&#x2019;t, it is not worth it. Blogging has immensely changed my life positively in the past three years; it is more evident to me this year and I am grateful for a platform such as this. It means a lot to me to own a portion of the cyber space and customize it the way I want. I get to express myself, have an audience and in turn inform/educate/orientate them on different aspects of living and journeying through life.

I am learning Integrity

This is more of cyber integrity. It is all about internet image. When you put yourself out there as a blogger, you present with you an image. A lot of people reading me don&#x2019;t know me but I never want to disappoint them. Even though I cannot bring up specific instances and people, I am certain to a degree that some people come to my blog to read my rants; some, my faith segment. Some are bloggers like me and they want to hear what I have to say in a new week. I cannot afford to let them down. I am learning how to keep up with the image I present of myself. How to keep my integrity even in the midst of demanding responsibilities e.g school.

I now know what it means to be dedicated

Back then I used to think that stay-at-home moms don&#x2019;t have much going on and so working from home is really nothing but now I realise that dedication is important in anything that we do. Very important. She could also be a failure in a home work career. Passion for a particular venture, career aids dedication anyway but I believe still that dedication is a conscious effort.

I am becoming more selfless

Whenever I want to put up a blog post, I think about my readers more than I of myself. If you take time to look through my past blogs, it was more of me me me. I wanted to express, rant and ramble and write about me alone. Boring people with my experiences seemed unfair and so I made up my mind to give my listeners something in return. You give me an avenue to express myself and I give you an avenue to learn something new, reinforce on your mind an idea or value and a cyber space to interact with other blog readers.

My social media followers used to complain that reading me was difficult. They found it difficult to get my point because of my use of English. All I did was throw words at them in a bid to express and release and vent and unleash. It&#x2019;s different now. I want to communicate; I want my readers to understand my articles and now I put in efforts to think of you than anything else.

My reading has improved

You won&#x2019;t believe that I sometimes read because I must have an excerpt to write on my blog at least once in two weeks. It is a spur on. My reading life has in turn improved positively. Voracious reading pays anyone and it has surely been of immense help in this life journey.

I am more versatile

I know about blogging, more about internet usage, online marketing, liaising with people, offline marketing of an online business, branding, convincing people to get involved. Like I said earlier, I now read a lot and that has added to my wealth of experience and versatility. I have a list of blogs I read to help me improve mine and see what others are doing. And you know what reading other people does? It makes you wiser and smarter. You gain from them what they are learning or took years to learn. I should be a thousand years old now given the number of stuff I have acquired.

I am learning how to listen and be taught

A number of people send me e-mails regularly to encourage me and give me feedback. Some of these feedbacks don&#x2019;t go down well with me but I have learnt that every successful person learned how to listen and use information for good.

So this is my own list. Any blogger in here? How has blogging changed your life?
