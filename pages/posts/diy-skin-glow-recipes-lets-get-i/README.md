Hello ladies? We know well that a glowing skin is a thing of joy to us, but most of us can&#x2019;t just get our skin to glow. We may have come to the end of that problem because here are DIY skin glow recipes that if followed properly could help.

*HONEY AND LEMON
 Honey and [lemon](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/diy-lemon-fruit-mask-for-hair-and-skin-1) are natural bleachers that helps the skin glow and radiate instantly.

INGREDIENTS
 1 tbsp lemon juice
 1tbsp honey

DIRECTIONS
 Take 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of honey. Mix honey and lemon together till the honey dissolves properly. Moisten your face and apply it on your face and leave it for 15-20 minutes. Wash your face thoroughly with cold water.

*OATS
 Oats work as a great scrubber and give your skin the shine and smoothness.

INGREDIENTS
 1/2 cup oats
 Warm water

DIRECTIONS
 Take &#xBD; cup of oats and pour a little warm water in it. Leave it for 5 minutes. Apply it on your face and gently rub and massage in a circular motion with your fingers. Rub harder around and on the nose to remove blackheads, for 15 minutes. Then, wash off with cold water.

*TOMATO
 Tomato also contains natural bleach properties that can help lighten skin colour.

DIRECTIONS
 Take a tomato and rub the tomato pulp on the skin. Rub it all over your face and leave it for 15 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with cold water after 15 minutes.

*GREEN APPLE
 Green apple works great in bringing back the lost glow.

DIRECTIONS
 Apply the pulp of green apple on your skin.

* OLIVE OIL
 Take a few drops of olive oil and apply it on the cheekbones, where you usually put on the blusher. This will give your face an instant glow. You can also use coconut oil or jojoba oil.

P.S- stay away from the lemon and honey and tomato recipes if you wouldn&#x2019;t want your skin any lighter. Have a beautiful glow, I&#x2019;d be waiting for feedback??
