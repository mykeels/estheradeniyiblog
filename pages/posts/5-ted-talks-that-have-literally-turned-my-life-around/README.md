I literally can&#x2019;t wait to begin to share some of the highlights of this year and other interesting stuff. Hopefully, this is not too early.

This year has been fully loaded with a lot of lessons, one of which my relationship breakup triggered. It is just like I grew up so fast this year. It&#x2019;s been such a cool ride, to say the least.

One of the major things I did was listen to people and read their books. I as such invested a lot of data in TED Talks. I did a lot of YouTube this year than all other years combined.

So, I am going to be sharing 5 of the most powerful TED Talks that literally changed my life. They changed my perspective, turned my life around and gave me a forceful spin.

It&#x2019;s funny that all of them are by women. I watched TED Talks by men but the ones that literally caused an impact the most are these ones I will be sharing below.

### Why You Need To Be A Bitch by&#xA0;Tabatha Coffey | TEDxStLouisWomen

Tabatha explains why you need to girl up and be powerful even though that is the least of what people expect of women. I have had to share on Facebook my concern about what people think of independent women and how people define them.

As long as I am in charge of my career, I am taking the right steps, I am not backing down in the face of challenges, I am seen as too masculine for comfort. This talk was all the proof I needed to know that it is not wrong after all&#xA0;to be strong and in control of my life.

### Girl Up: The Secrets to an Extraordinary Life | Courtney Ferrell | TEDxRVA

One of the things I picked from this talk is that you should make enough money for yourself as a woman enough to keep your ego. In the least, have vex money to get yourself back home and pay for your dinner in case your date is a jerk.

### Trust your struggle | Zain Asher | TEDxEuston

Oh my, Zain was very transparent in this talk. She literally gave herself away and inspired the courage to continue. The struggle is part of the process of Becoming and I personally think that it is necessary.

### The wait is sexy | Yvonne Orji | TEDxWilmingtonSalon

I listened to **The Wait Is Sexy by Yvonne Orji** several times than I can count. I listened over and over and over. I shared with all of my single girlfriends. I listened until every single of the 5 points she said in this speech sank in.

This is one talk you should listen to if you are single and patiently waiting. I was so overjoyed when I learned that she now has a man in her life. Damn, he is a&#xA0;tall glass of chocolate!

### The person you really need to marry | Tracy McMillan | TEDxOlympicBlvdWomen

This talk reminds me of why I need to be whole as a woman. You would be dazed at how much of herself Tracy let out in this TED Talk. It was an intimate conversation between her and the hearts of her listeners I bet.

To come out in the open to say all of your relationship challenges, not just relationship, marital! And also why you failed? Oh my, that was a move.

She indeed needed to drive the point home and that one point that I could not remember to forget was that to be right for someone else, you must be gracious enough to be right for yourself.
