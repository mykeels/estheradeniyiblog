If you have ever had questions about intermittent fasting and you are looking for answers to whether it would affect your financial life, I have good news. Intermittent fasting will not only improve your body, including weight loss, but it will help control your food budget as well.

To achieve intermittent fasting, you do not have to drill a hole in your pocket like you might have to do to make a success of some of the dieting programs for weight loss. The other day, a friend said how expensive a fruit fast is, despite the silence around money issues and weight loss.

The modern era has seen an influx of fad diets and almost all of them are usually created with the mindset of separating you from your money. Fasting is a medically accepted method of controlling when and how much goes into your body each day. By exerting this control over your food intake, you can also control how much you are spending on said nourishment.

Oh, if you do not properly understand all of the talks about intermittent fasting, to begin with, [this article is your best bet](https://estheradeniyi.com/intermittent-fasting-to-lose-belly-fat/), trust me.

While intermittent fasting is not the answer to all of your problems with food and finances, it is the first step to a healthy life and a better relationship with food.

Studies have shown the accidental financial benefits of intermittent fasting. After a few weeks of only eating 2 meals (lunch and dinner) every day, you will begin to notice that your body and bank account will start sending you new messages.

Because of this, here are the 3 biggest financial benefits ever:

No more impulse eating and food purchases. There is no longer the need to stop and buy snacks, drinks or go-to meals throughout the day just to keep the energy levels up.

Eating only two meals (and sometimes a drink between) per day means fewer meals to cook/buy. Whether it&#x2019;s cooking two meals at home or going out for the occasional meal, you just end up spending less money on food.
 Less food waste. Eating 3 meals a day just because that&#x2019;s what you are was used to would end you up with too many leftovers. With intermittent fasting, you only buy what you need and eat it all!

Observations made is that total food spending (restaurants and groceries) will drop by $100 per month when you start IF schedule, so the financial benefits aren&#x2019;t huge, but when you factor in the health benefits, you find that IF is win-win overall!

The good thing about intermittent fasting is that you never get into foggy state, as your mind stays sharp and acute throughout the day, or at least until you eat.

When we were hunter-gatherers we needed that extra focus to attain our next meal. Your body is essentially giving you the tools to acquire what it needs.

The longer you fast, the more acute this sensation becomes. Some studies even push the fasting window into the days or up to a week.

Intermittent fasting is the process of shortening the fasting window versus these long term strategies. The intermittent part is what helps most people keep their sanity without food.

Imagine going through your workday completely focused and ready for whatever the world throws at you. No mid-afternoon lull where you feel like you could collapse at your desk. Fasting will help you achieve that mental acuity.
