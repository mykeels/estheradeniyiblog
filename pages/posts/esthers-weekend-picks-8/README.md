Hey hey hey! What&#x2019;s uuuuuuuuup? I know right. Too much excitement though. Thing is, this has been a very roller-coaster week. I hate menstrual periods fam. My hormones are literally everywhere. This one time I feel so good, the next, I feel very awful. DAMMIT!

I feel good as we speak, lol. I am just waiting for a hormonal surge and all of a sudden my red is being unfair with me. Speaking of which I would share with you what I recently tried and absolutely loved.&#xA0;

But like hollup though, did you listen to this week&#x2019;s podcast? It was insane! We made magic fam. Check it out [here](https://estheradeniyi.com/things-we-hate-the-most/). We discussed 10 things that we hate.&#xA0;

This week&#x2019;s picks are absolutely to love, as usual!

1. I tried and looooooooove tampons so much that I am not going back. Thank you so much for your contributions the other day [on my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2zF8mPl4SS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). It was so helpful! I was able to reach a tampon brand decision and I am so not going back to menstrual pads again. Ever! I swear!

2. This couple [skipped a big wedding](https://www.xonecole.com/we-eloped-why-we-chose-real-estate/) to buy real estate. I kind of somewhat in a way like, love it.

3. Turn your pain to power. This plus-sized model was going to be having the worst day of her life but then, she changed her mind.&#xA0;

5. &#x201C;*As the daughter of a Nigerian CFO and accountant and one of five girls, Tiffany says that she was introduced to the concept of financial wellness early-on in her life. She explained, &#x201C;[My dad] taught us about money because he wanted to make sure that who we chose to marry was not as a result of what we needed from them; that we can take care of ourselves*.&#x201D; &#x2013; Budgetnista for [XONECOLE](https://www.xonecole.com/the-budgetnista/?rebelltitem=7#rebelltitem7)

6. How to [start making money](https://www.pulse.ng/bi/tech/how-to-start-a-money-making-youtube-and-instagram-influencer-career-using-your/6m6w29x) on Youtube using your smartphone

7. Something just has to trend in Nigeria! [What is this](https://guardian.ng/news/fact-check-is-buhari-really-marrying-another-wife/)????

8. This is my best Halloween [makeup idea](https://promakeuptutor.com/halloween-makeup-ideas/resultado-de-imagem-para-fantasy-halloween-makeup-ideas-beauty/) so far. I like that it is not the scariest.&#xA0;

9. Why the heck would anyone [wear makeup to the gym?](https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/wear-makeup-gym/)&#xA0;Really.&#xA0;

10. The number of squats you need to have the [perfect butt](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/the-number-of-squats-you-need-to-do-to-get-the-perfect-butt/articleshow/71542286.cms). Na you dey find butt na.

13. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay to outgrow your friendships&#x201D;- Necole

14. Tiffany Haddish demonstrates lazy stripper moves. You are welcome!

15. This reader&#x2019;s comment on my [Domino&#x2019;s Pizza&#x2019;s Post](https://estheradeniyi.com/dominos-pizza-and-cold-stone-creamery-now-in-ilorin-kwara-state/) is a call to Domino&#x2019;s Pizza Nigeria. They are doing a very awful job at the Ilorin branch here. I can testify!&#xA0;

&#x201C;*Your customer care is pretty poor. I was served by a fair lady with open(gap) teeth, quite mentally unbalanced and disrespectful. Turned my icecream from a cone to another in a wishy-washy manner and used water from the spoon wash basin to pat my icecream. As if that wasn&#x2019;t enough, spread some coloured chocolate on my ice cream without my opinion and flagged me a #1550 bill against her initial estimation. I felt pretty bad. It was more of using my money to buy disgust and dared not ask questions. I think you should train your servers. The one that served me has no conventional behavior. I was hurt and a customer that narrate her experience elsewhere was lost*.&#x201D;

16. [Diversify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPkz8S4KTF0&amp;t=3s) your income streams bruh.

P.S &#x2013; [Tampons vs pads](https://estheradeniyi.com/tampons-vs-pads/)
