&#x201C;Lagos State
 Governor&#x2019;s wife, Mrs Bolanle Ambode yesterday urged women to embrace creative
 entrepreneurship skills for sustainable development within the family and
 communities.&#x201D;- [The Nation](http://thenationonlineng.net/acquire-creative-skills-ambodes-wife-urges-women/)

Addressing
 reporters at the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre in Alausa, Mrs Ambode, who is the
 Chairperson of the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO), said
 women as helpmates were uniquely created and endowed with skills to impact
 positively on the family, environment and society.

She said:
 &#x201C;You will agree with me that women are blessed with creative skills that out of
 very little she creates something and she can even transform the little created
 to something bigger and better. Empowered women can become not only
 wage-earners but also job-creators and this is imperative for eradicating
 poverty in our nation.

&#x201C;We,
 therefore, call on women who wish to make a difference for themselves and their
 families to adapt to new challenges and keep up with the changing times. This
 they can do by using whatever vocational skills they have to improve their
 economic status.

&#x201C;We are also
 calling on government at all levels to invest in women&#x2019;s economic empowerment
 to spur growth and development in the country.&#x2019;&#x2019;

On the
 forthcoming National Women Conference organised by COWLSO, Mrs. Ambode said
 wife of the Vice President, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, Governor of Akwa Ibom State,
 Emmanuel Udom and his counterpart in Adamawa State, Alhaji Jibrilla Bindo are
 among top dignitaries to grace the occasion.

She said the
 wife of the Vice-President would open the conference.

This year&#x2019;s
 conference,&#xA0; themed:&#xA0; &#x2018;She Creates, She Transforms,&#x2019; will hold
 between October 24 and 26 at the Convention Centre of Eko Hotel and Suites,
 Victoria Island, Lagos.

Mrs Ambode
 said renowned facilitators from all walks of life would give insight on
 selected relevant topics, ranging from Networking etiquette, women in
 agriculture, women empowerment, financing options for businesses, among other
 issues.

She said the
 theme of the conference was carefully selected to showcase ingenuity of
 Nigerian women in providing practical solutions towards achieving sustainable
 development.

Mrs. Ambode
 also said an award of inspirational women of the year would also be presented
 to a distinguished&#xA0; woman achiever, who has excelled in her chosen career,
 mentored other women and has supported the vision of the group.

&#xA0;

The COWLSO
 chairman explained that buses would be stationed at Yaba, Mile 2, Berger,
 Agege, Iyana Ipaja and Ajah, to convey the women to and from the venue of the
 Gala Night.
