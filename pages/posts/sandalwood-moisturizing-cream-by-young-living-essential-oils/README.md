**Sandalwood moisturizing cream** was never prepared for, thought about or planned for. It was a gift and I am so grateful it happened.

You know I am only beginning to gradually take skin care, especially my facial skin care, seriously and this is not by dumping many products on it but by being selective with quality, tested and proven products.

Last year, I was terribly dissatisfied with my excessively oily skin, maybe combination/mixed skin because my T junction is what&#x2019;s usually oily. My cheeks and neck go fine and dry. As at the time, I would even wake up with so much of oil on my face and that really got me very uncomfortable. You can literally feel oil on your face.

So, I took to Instagram to rant and look for solutions. One of my followers, @lipsnailslife had pointed me to the fact that I might not be moisturizing my face enough. See the Instagram post below:

Before I finally give up on my slay queen project, help me. How can this oil production stop? If for anything, it should be crude oil that will convert to money, not this katikati o. _______ P.

Well, all these were too new for me. Amidst the numerous suggestions I got that day, I set my heart to begin deep facial moisturizing, only that I did not know what products to go for. I also did not want to begin trial and error on my face so I was determined to go for something on a recommendation.

My prayers were going to be answered when **Young Living Essential Oils** came down to Nigeria. I was gifted a lot more other essential oils by Young Living but I became particularly drawn to the **Sandalwood Moisturizing Cream by Young Living essential oils** and this had to do with the former discussion I had with my Instagram followers the other day.

I came back home and that night was the first time I used the product. It&#x2019;s been two weeks I began using and I think I could do a review. I scooped out some for my mum to use too so hopefully, I will update this post as she experiences the Sandalwood Moisturizing Cream.

## Importance of moisturizing the face

Somehow, I think writing about the importance of moisturizing the face will help you understand why Sandalwood moisturizing cream has been such a good addition to my facial routine.

Whatever your routine, moisturizing is an important step. Below are the benefits of moisturizing your skin.

- It helps to keep your skin hydrated
- It prevents anti-aging by giving your skin a soft, young looking feel.
- A good moisturizer can help to treat your dry skin
- It is also a good base between the sun and your skin.
- A moisturizer can be used as a protective base for your makeup
- It can also replace your face cream.

## Sandalwood moisturizing cream product description

Sandalwood moisturizing cream by Young Living essential oils comes in a majorly white container. Its net weight is 4 oz. (113g). Container content is a white thick lotion with a very fine consistency.

After the outer cover comes a lid which you have to pull out to reveal the product. The smell is very lovely with a strong lemongrass kind of fragrance

## What I like about Sandalwood moisturizing cream by Young Living Essential Oils

**The packaging**: I know that I can be a little bit petty and vain but don&#x2019;t you think the packaging of a product has some sort of psychological effect on people? Because it does on me and it may be a little bit strange that I am mentioning it for the first time.

I love the way Sandalwood moisturizing cream comes. It brings the exotic branding in its packaging. That I have to pull out a layer of cover after turning open the lid is just very cool, to me lol.

**The smell**: oh my, the smell is therapeutic on its own. One of the things my mum noted on first use was the smell. She loved it so much and so do I.

**100% pure, essential oil**: Young Living essential oil is known for 100% pure therapeutic-grade essential oils. They are known for the seed to seal technology. This means that they do not add any other additives to their products.

![sandalwood moisture cream- 100% therapeutic grade, pure essential oils](images\sandalwood-moisturizing-cream-by-young-living-essential-oils-4.png)

These products are straight from the farm, extracted, purified, mixed with other straight from the farm products and packaged. Many of the organic products that claim to be natural are usually with other things added.

When a product is, however, seed to seal, it means that you are guaranteed of no sneaky addition to the raw material in the processes of processing and packaging. The essential oils the product is infused with are 100% pure.

**Feel and effect**: my face feels very soft and hydrated. I mentioned earlier about my oily face in the mornings. This has been greatly reduced. After application, it is very well absorbed by my skin and that is such a very good plus.

## Personal caution

Sandalwood moisturizing cream has Shea butter in it even though I do not know to what degree or proportion. I am always very careful about Shea butter and Shea butter products.

This is because one of the [side effects of shea butter](https://estheradeniyi.com/shea-butter/) is the darkening of the skin. It reacts with Ultraviolet rays to cause a darkening.

So, what I do is use Sandalwood moisturizing cream only at night time before I go to bed. I do not use in the mornings when I know I will be out and about in the sun. When I use it in the morning, I am pretty much sure that I will be indoors most of the time.

Nevertheless, I could give it a try, use a couple of times on my regular days and see what happens. I am not sure I want to use my face like a lab experiment but I could just try and see the reaction, lol.

## Recommendation

Yes, I would recommend Sandalwood moisturizing cream by Young Living Essential Oil.
