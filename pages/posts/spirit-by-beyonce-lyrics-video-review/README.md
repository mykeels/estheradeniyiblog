Watching [**The Lion King**](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-lion-king/) yesterday was such a fabulous experience. It was more than a movie for me, it was a whole, total experience. I am so proud to be African right now. I am also proud to be brown-skinned and to be Nigerian.

It is such a blessing to have Beyonce to listen to, watch and learn from. Of all the songs on her most recent album, *The Lion King: The Gift*, &#x201C;Spirit&#x201D; has brought the best vibes out for me.

## Spirit Track Review

The song starts with a Swahili chant, Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme. This translates to &#x201C;long live the king.&#x201D;

The lyrics also contain an excerpt from one of the Lion King scenes: &#x201C;Sayin&#x2019; rise up / To the light in the sky, yeah / Let the light lift your heart up,&#x201D;

![Spirit in Beyonce, Spirit song, Spirit music](images\Spirit-by-Beyonce.jpg)

Beyonce goes on ahead to quote portions of the old testament of the Bible: &#x201C;So go into that far off land / And be one with the Great I Am, I Am / A boy becomes a man.&#x201D;

## Blue Ivy&#x2019;s Cameo in Spirit

**Blue Ivy&#x2019;s, stylish cameo** in Beyonce&#x2019;s spirit music video is what the whole world is talking about. Not only was she spectacular, but she was also a reminder of an everlasting Beyonce.

## Spirit&#x2019;s music video and Africanism

Beyonce seems to [pay homage to Yemoja](https://www.konbini.com/ng/lifestyle/heres-beyonce-pays-homage-yoruba-goddess-yemoja-spirit-video/), a Yoruba goddess in many clips of the videos with different poses and attires that mimic the goddess. This is coupled with that some moves are an inspiration from African culture and mannerisms.

Spirit by Beyonce exudes a level of brilliance that is certainly unmatched and beautiful. If you love Spirit by Beyonce, you might want to know all of what she said in the song. Below, the lyrics of &#x201C;Spirit&#x201D; by Beyonce.

## [Lyrics] Spirit by Beyonce

Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
 (Uishi kwa, uishi kwa)
 Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
 (Uishi kwa, uishi kwa)

Yeah, yeah, and the wind is talkin&#x2019;
 Yeah, yeah, for the very first time
 With a melody that pulls you towards it
 Paintin&#x2019; pictures of paradise

Sayin&#x2019;, rise up
 To the light in the sky, yeah
 Watch the light lift your heart up
 Burn your flame through the night

Woah, spirit
 Watch the heavens open, yeah
 Spirit, can you hear it callin&#x2019;? (Callin&#x2019;)
 Yeah

![Beyonce gestures like an African with her girls, Beyonce in yellow in Spirit&apos;s music video,](images\Spirit-by-Beyonce-Music-video.jpg)

Yeah, yeah, and the water&#x2019;s crashin&#x2019;
 Trying to keep your head up high
 While you&#x2019;re trembling, that&#x2019;s when the magic happens
 And the stars gather by, by your side

Sayin&#x2019; rise up
 To the light in the sky, yeah
 Let the light lift your heart up
 Burn your flame through the night

Yeah, spirit
 Watch the heavens open, yeah
 Spirit, can you hear it callin&#x2019;? (Callin&#x2019;)
 Yeah

Your destiny is comin&#x2019; close
 Stand up and fight

So go into that far off land
 And be one with the great I Am, I Am
 A boy becomes a man

Woah, spirit
 Watch the heavens open, yeah
 Spirit, can you hear it callin&#x2019;? Yeah
 Spirit, yeah, watch the heavens open, open, yeah
 Spirit, spirit, can you hear it callin&#x2019;? (Callin&#x2019;)
 Yeah

Your destiny is comin&#x2019; close
 Stand up and fight

So go into a far off land
 And be one with the great I Am
