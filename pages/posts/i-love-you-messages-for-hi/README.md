Seasons and times change, events happen and the tide turns but my heart will forever remain yours even through thick and thin.

People told me I foolishly fell in love with you. I thanked them and moved on only to realize that foolishness in love is the best feeling I can ever have. Let me remain a fool.

I just don&#x2019;t want to be in your arms for the sake of it. I want being in your arms the world you see and the air you breathe. I love you.

The assurance of my love for you is to tell you that you mean more than I can express in one instance. I love you my wife.

Loving you is never a mistake and it will never be. I love you

When people ask me how I fell for you, I always tell them I do not know. The truth is &#x2013; I really don&#x2019;t know. Its unexplainable.

I opened up my heart to you simply because I believed I wont be making a mistake with you. You have proved my decision right time and time again. I love you.

Like the breeze that blow by the seashore, your love has blown my heart and now I feel safe with you. Nothing can separate us baby.

There is nothing I want more than to be in your arms this moment. I want to feel your heart against mine. I want you to take me far away beyond this world. I love you

Keep me locked in your heart, alone with you the same way you are in mine. Let us see the beauty of our inside together. I love you.

At night like this, I stretch my hand to reach you. I know that even though you are far away, our hearts are forever in sync with each other. Stretch your hand and hold mine baby.

I open my window and I look into the street searching for you. One wish that I have is that I hear a knock on my door with you on the other side. I love you.

Baby, I am standing at the spot where I first saw you and pictures of you flash across the street. I cant seem to forget how it all happened. We happened baby, we happened. I love you baby.

I promise to hold your hand &#xA0;through the storms and rain. Never let you go even when you want to all because I love you.

The only reason why my world remains beautiful is because you are in it. I&#x2019;m sure yours is beautiful as well because I am there.

After I had searched and couldn&#x2019;t find anyone, I gave up. But the very day I gave up was the day I found you. I&#x2019;m happy I waited that long before giving up. I love you hubby

I thought I was going to wait forever for love until I found you. I&#x2019;m never going to let you go baby. We are stuck together, forever. I love you honey.

As each second ticks, I begin to count down the moment I will see you again. I cant wait to hold you in my arms again. I love you sweetheart.

Slow music, faint lighting, a bottle of wine with two glasses. The two of us together lost in the euphoria of our love. Lets do magic baby.

If you ever leave me, it would be you never loved me. I have placed my heart in your hands baby, it is fragile. Don&#x2019;t ever let it fall.

I feel shattered into pieces when you hurt me. I feel on top of the world when you love me. If I am to choose, I prefer the latter. I love you.

I want us to see the world together, capture moments together, eat together and drink together. I want to go places with you my love.

One of the most amazing feelings is having you in my arms all through the night. I don&#x2019;t ever want to let you go. Never! I love you love.

When our lips lock together in bliss, I don&#x2019;t ever want them to separate. You do to me things I cannot find the right words to explain. I love you.

At the end of this journey, I want to look into your eyes and say to you that this journey has no end. It is forever. I love you.

Let us runaway into a far world of bliss &#x2013; our world. A place no one can find us. Let us enjoy ourselves till we lose strength to continue.

My love for you is renewed each day like the eagle&#x2019;s strength high up in the sky. I see strength to carry on when I see you. I love you.

At my lowest ebb, you have pulled me up. I find it easy to yield to you than any one else. Don&#x2019;t ever let me go baby.

I want to remain lost, lost in your arms, lost in our world. A world we would both create. Our own perfect world. I love you.

When your hands run over my body, I feel a different type of sensation. A sensation mighty enough to erupt a volcano from the high mountains of Himalaya. Love you baby.

They say love is blind. Ours isn&#x2019;t. The eyes with which see the world is different from that of others. They see things ordinary people cannot see. I love you.

I want to appreciate you for loving me more than I deserve. Most times I ask myself why I deserve you but then I realize I don&#x2019;t deserve you. Maybe, you deserve me more.

As high as the mountain top is, as strong as the hardest rock is, as deep as the ocean depth is, my love for you is immeasurable. I love you.

When I listen to your voice over the phone, I just want you continue speaking nonstop. I can never be tired of hearing you. I love your voice, and I love you.

Words alone are not enough to express what you do to me. It is only in you I have found true peace and most of all, true love.

At some point in life, I thought I had lost it all and would never be able to know what true love means. I was right until I met you. Thank you for loving me.

Just like the sand by the seashore is uncountable, my love for you remains immeasurable and the joy I feel for you, not quantifiable.

 You don&#x2019;t just mean anything to me. You mean this world and the one to come. If I had the opportunity to exchange the world with you, I would turn it down.&#xA0;I love you.

 Let us promise that despite the trials and hardships, the good times and successes, and till infinity ends, we will keep holding hands and remain in love.

 By the time I am done loving you here on earth, I will love you in eternity also. Just to show the mortals and immortals that our love is inseparable.&#xA0;I love you.

My love for you is bigger than the large expanse of waters and deeper than the ocean depths. I try to see how big it is but my sight can&#x2019;t go further because I keep seeing you.

 Baby, I want to build a world with you, where I can be reckless with you and still feel like myself. I want to love such that when you tell me I love you too much, I&#x2019;ll tell you I haven&#x2019;t started.

 I just do not want us to live together. I want us to build an empire and succeed together with wonderful kids around us.&#xA0;I love you.

 It&#x2019;s only cold out there when you are away. Even winter seems warmer whenever we are together. I never want to spend a single day without you.

 The only type of intimacy I want with you is where we can lay back, laugh together, hold hands, look into each other&#x2019;s eyes and say stupid things about ourselves. I love you dearly.

 If all I had left was one breath, the only words I would whisper to your ears would be &#x201C;I LOVE YOU&#x201D;. If I had two, I would use the second one to give you a kiss.&#xA0;I love you.
