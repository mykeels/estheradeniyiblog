[Nollywood stars](https://buzznigeria.com/beautifulhottestsexiest-nollywood-actresses/),&#xA0;Ramsey Nouah&#xA0;and&#xA0;Omoni Oboli brought their A -game to the screen. &#xA0;My Wife And I&#xA0;was directed by&#xA0;Bunmi Ajakaiye and produced by&#xA0;Inkblot&#xA0;and&#xA0;Agency106.

&#x201C;The synopsis is uncomplicated; Ebere (Omoni Oboli) and Toyosi (Ramsey Nouah) have been married for 17 years and have two teenagers. Ebere is a career woman/strict mother while Toyosi is a farmer/cool dad. They hit a bump in their relationship and at the insistence of their parents, go to pastor Theophilus (Seyi Law) for counseling.&#xA0;In an interesting turn of events (maybe by a higher power or just kismet), Ebere and Toyosi switch minds. The have to navigate each other&#x2019;s careers and lives with no expertise.&#x201D; &#x2013; [Konbini](http://www.konbini.com/ng/entertainment/watch-ramsey-noah-and-omoni-oboli-pull-a-freaky-friday-in-my-wife-and-i/)
