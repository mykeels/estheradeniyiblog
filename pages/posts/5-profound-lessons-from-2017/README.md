2017 was a beautiful year for me. I am not your girl when we discuss years in retrospect. I also really don&#x2019;t like the idea of resolutions and goals for the new year. I have done that in the past and they more of handicapped than motivate me to be better, to accomplish better. I only have a bird&#x2019;s eye view of what I want for the nearest future and I go for it, phase by phase, step by step, moment by moment.

I had a lot of fun in 2017, I went through a lot of trials, I learned a lot of lessons. Below are 5 of them:

#### 1. Not all relationships are the same

When we see the glory of other people&#x2019;s relationships, we forget that they have worked hard to get there and of a fact, they are still working. A [blissful relationship](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/search/label/Relationships?max-results=6) is only reflective of the people involved. A relationship that seems dysfunctional might not be as dysfunctional as it seems. We are cementing two souls together. &#xA0;My relationship can never ever be like yours no matter how hard I try.

#### 2. God loves us no matter what

This is never an excuse to be spiritually lazy. In all of our inconsistent attitudes, the Lord still proves himself faithful. I have had cause to approach the Lord with so much of guilt. Over time I have come to realize that God only wants me to come to him as I am, in reverence and humility.

2017 taught me more of God&#x2019;s love and graciousness. This year taught me of God&#x2019;s faithfulness despite my unfaithfulness. It taught me that [he understands my humanity and that drives me into spiritual ecstasy](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/jesus-understands-my-humanity-and-that).

#### 3. Use what you have for now

Career wise, I have learned to use what I have at the moment. There is a temptation to stall what we are supposed to do in expectation of better resources, better working conditions and a robust provision.

I learned in 2017 that it is a waste of time and talent to wait until we have everything to do what we are supposed to do. As long as what we have is enough to do the job, execute.

Conditions are not always going to be perfect. I have learned not to waste opportunities because I am not yet in my comfort zone. As long as what I have at hand works, I will go on ahead, build, until I can have all I want. Surprisingly, you can never have all you want because there is usually a drive for better.

#### 4. Social media can be deceptive

Social media is good, in fact, it is one of the best tools I have to work with to grow my audience as a Blogger. However, my experience as the average social media user has taught me not to believe every single thing. I am supposed to learn how to filter and sieve information.

I should never be driven by what I perceive. [Social media](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/annoying-things-people-say-on-social) is an online congregation, I do not see what exactly happens to these individuals offline. In 2017, so many secrets were revealed. Social media celebrities were pulled down. We discovered that some of them lived a lie, deceived people, defrauded some and hurt some people.

#### 5. Problems pass with time

I have learned in 2017 not to give up. Sometimes problems come with so much of arrogance. They seem to be so overwhelming that you are entangled with despair. I have had very difficult times in 2017. They looked like they were going to swallow me. All through this year, I learned that as time passes, the problems expire.

It is very important for me to [develop a positive attitude](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/3-bright-tips-to-staying-positive) in the midst of these problems. I have to understand that these problems do not and will not define me, they are only phases of life.

What lessons did you learn in 2017? Please share with me.
