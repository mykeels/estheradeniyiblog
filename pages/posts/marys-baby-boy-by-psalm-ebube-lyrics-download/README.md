## Mary&#x2019;s Baby Boy by Psalm Ebube Lyrics

See the lights are fading
 Fireworks sparkling
 And the stars are shining now
 Mary&#x2019;s baby boy
 Was given to us&#x2026;just to save humanity

Also: [Alagbada Ina by Nathaniel Bassey](https://estheradeniyi.com/alagbada-ina-by-nathaniel-bassey-lyrics/)

From the east the wise men
 Brought gifts to please him
 For a king was born to us
 They brought him gold, myrrh and frankincense
 For our king is born

**[Chorus]**
 Merry Merry christmas
 to you and your kins
 Good tidings we bring
 To you and yours
 For a king is born to us&#x2026;

Also: [Jesus at the center by Eben](https://estheradeniyi.com/jesus-at-center-by-eben-lyrics-mp3/)

Mary&#x2019;s baby boy
 So cute and handsome
 In the manger where he laid
 He&#x2019;s our prince of peace
 And He came to ease
 Our pain and our shame
 Make haste to meet him
 Make haste to greet him
 For a king is born to us.
 They called him wonderful
 For a king is born&#x2026;

Also: [Nagode by Solomon Lange](https://estheradeniyi.com/nagode-by-solomon-lange-lyrics/)

**[Bridge]**

Whistle ooooo
 Oh&#x2026; it&#x2019;s time to celebrate

Everybody jubilate&#x2026;.
