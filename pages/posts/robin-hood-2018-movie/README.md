The first time I saw **Robin Hood trailer,** I knew I was going to go see it as soon as it was released. On Friday, after work, I went to see Hunter Killer (2018), which was by the way, as usual, unplanned.

I just walked into the cinema, listened to chatter and went for it. I was supposed to write a review but I thought against it. I didn&#x2019;t want all of my blog posts to be just movies, this is not a movie blog lol.

Movies have come to be a major part of my life and this is because I don&#x2019;t have a very much vibrant social life. My life revolves around work, church and my bed.

But Hunter Killer was goooooooooooooood. Oh so good. I had said on my status that it is one of such action movies that isn&#x2019;t clich&#xE9;. The mix of politics, action, tact, loads of lessons was just perfect.

One of the trailers that was shown in the cinema before Hunter Killer was of Robin Hood and I said to myself again. I am seeing this movie fam. I just didn&#x2019;t know it would be so quick because the time frame between when I said I would see it and when I eventually saw it was less than 24 hours.

I went back into the cinema yesterday and bought the ticket. Just before I entered, I looked up and saw a long queue at one of the cinema halls. Shu, what movie was showing there. I walked up to ask one of them and she said, [King of Boys.](https://estheradeniyi.com/king-of-boys-movie/)

I just rolled my eyes away. [King of Boys was there to haunt me](https://estheradeniyi.com/king-of-boys-2018-movie-review-esther-adeniyi/) again. Jeeez. Why haven&#x2019;t I bought this thing and seen it na?

So, Robin Hood, watch the trailer first.

## Robin Hood Rating

![Robin Hood 2018](images\Robin-Hood.jpg)

Many people (definitely not average people, movie critics in this case) did not like Robin Hood (2018) and I think this is because they have seen the Robin Hood of different years and had a very high expectation. I haven&#x2019;t yet seen any Robin Hood movie so this was a pleasant movie for me as I had no previous images in my head, nothing. It was going to be fresh off the bat.

IMDb &#x2013; 6.9/10
 Rotten Tomatoes &#x2013; 11%
 Empire &#x2013; 2/5
 Google users &#x2013; 81% liked Robin Hood
