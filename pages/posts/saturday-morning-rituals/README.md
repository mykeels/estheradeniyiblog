**Write a feasible to-do list**

Here&#x2019;s the drift, do not write your list with the idea that you are Iron man. Remember, the goal isn&#x2019;t to turn your weekend into a &#x2018;feast of chores&#x2019;. Dedicate some time on Saturday morning to pen down a list of things you should do in the course of the weekend.

This should include meal plans, events, chores, and other errands alongside. This will serve as a schedule reminder and this way, you would hardly miss a thing!

**Prepare yourself for the day**

The grand psychology behind productivity is getting yourself prepared for whatever task is ahead. In this case, don&#x2019;t go making every Saturday morning a lazy one. Sometimes, take your work pants on, put your hair up and get to work. Prepare yourself mentally as well and insist on &#x2018;positive vibes only!&#x2019;

**Attack the laundry and dishes right away**

Get the bad guys out of the way first. Yes, the heap of laundry and dishes are the &#x2018;enemy&#x2019;. Once you can find a way to utilize your Saturday morning in kicking this personal cleaning out of the way, its way to go honey! You know how you feel so fresh and alive when everywhere look clean?

Now, that&#x2019;s how you work towards a satisfying weekend.

When all is said and done, what matters, in the end, is that these Saturday morning rituals turn your weekend into a perfect goal. With this in mind, switch things up every once in a while so you don&#x2019;t even up with a tiresome routine.
