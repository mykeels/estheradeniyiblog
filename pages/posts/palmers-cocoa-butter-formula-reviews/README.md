## **Why Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter is so good**

**Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter for stretch marks**

![PALMER&apos;S COCOA BUTTER FOR STRETCH MARKS](images\PALMERS-COCOA-BUTTER-FOR-STRETCH-MARKS-1.png)

The people who will love Palmer&#x2019;s Cocoa butter the most are pregnant women and this is because of the stretch marks they have around the thighs, hips, buttocks and tummy areas. Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter reduces the appearance of stretch marks on the skin.

The truth is that I cannot categorically say that it removes stretch marks completely but what I can guarantee is making the stretch marks fade away and have lesser intensity than before.

Some pregnant women who begin to use Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter right from the start of pregnancy noticed that they didn&#x2019;t have a single stretch mark show up for a very long time and then when they had anything come up, it was so faint and minimal that they counted it negligible.

I would also like to mention that I strongly think that it depends on the degree and age of stretch marks. I personally do not think that Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter would work on stretch marks that are years long gone. I may be wrong though but this is just to prepare your mind.

>>>You might like to also try [original shea butter if you have issues with stretch marks](https://estheradeniyi.com/shea-butter/). If you click on that link, it will take you down to a very comprehensive shea butter article, you can learn how to use it for your stretch marks.

>>> If you have a problem with frequent weight fluctuations or would like a more intense stretch mark massage and treatment, you can go for&#xA0;**Palmer&#x2019;s Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Lotion For Stretch Marks**

**It smells so nice**

I, personally love anything that has to do with cocoa butter. I love the smell of cocoa on its own. My parents use cocoa powder frequently and even though I do not love the taste of ordinarily except it has enough milk added, the smell makes a good day out of my day.

This is what drew me towards [Nivea cocoa butter lotion](https://estheradeniyi.com/nivea-cocoa-butter-body-lotion-review/). My sister got it before me but I found out that it was so good and so I binged on it during the holidays. I must say the smell was what got me hooked before anything else.

Some people complain about the **smell of Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter** but this is proof that we are all different and that not everyone is okay with everything.

**Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter is deeply moisturizing**

The moisturizing property of Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter is definitely one of the reasons why it has some added advantages e.g stretch marks visibility reduction and skin elasticity advantage. Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter claims to keep your skin supple and deeply moisturizing for up to 48 hours.

**Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter can be used for scar therapy**

This is a review by other people. I have never had to consciously use it for any scar treatment. People, however, claim to see much progress after using this product for a while. According to them, redness goes down substantially and later the marks are almost invisible until they fade away.

**It absorbs deeply and evenly**

I like Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter because my skin absorbs it really fast. In fact, you would almost not feel it as soon as you rub it in. Only that you know that you have applied body cream.

This happens because Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter melts just below body temperature. So, as soon as you begin to rub it against your skin, your body quickly generates some heat as a result of the friction and this makes absorption rate double up.

**Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter heals eczema**

I have never tried Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter for this, I am banking on other people&#x2019;s reviews of it for eczema. They claim that it worked really well for it and that it completely cleared off all the patches. If you have eczema, you can try this body cream in combination with African black soap. [African black soap](https://estheradeniyi.com/african-black-soap/) has been known to help clear eczema, you can click on that link to check all of how African black soap can help.

## **What I don&#x2019;t like about Palmer&#x2019;s Cocoa butter**

**It is heavier than I would like**

The texture of Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter is wax-like and it has a &#x201C;slightly thicker than I like&#x201D; consistency. This is originally why I ran away from many of the Vaseline creams and related heavy like creams.

It makes it feel as if I am dumping a truckload of product on my skin and I kind of get scared of blocking up my pores. Yes, it absorbs quickly but even at that, I don&#x2019;t like the thickness. I have never tried the lotion though. I may change my mind if the lotion solves this problem.

**Not as affordable as a lot of people claim**

I will discuss price options later on in this post. I think that &#x201C;affordable&#x201D; is relative and that it means different things to different people. I still do not think it is affordable compared to some of the other great products that I have reviewed.

You can read some of them and then compare. This might not be the best option for students for example. Just saying.

## **How to use Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter**

Use Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter as soon as you leave the shower and dry up. It helps to cause the products to smoothen into your skin more effectively and be absorbed. Scoop just little and slather on your skin as it spreads really well.

## **Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter ingredients**

Deionized Water, Cocoa Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, [Coconut Oil](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-make-coconut-oil-at-home/), Mineral Oil, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Cocoa Butter, Palm Oil, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Fragrance, PEG 8 Stearate, Methylparaben, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propylparaben, Yellow 5 CI 19140, Orange 4 CI 15510

## **Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter reviews**

&#x201C;Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter is the go to if you want soft, smooth skin and let&#x2019;s not forget that it smells soooo good. It&#x2019;s great for dry skin and harsh weathers but is still gentle on sensitive skin and doesn&#x2019;t make you sweat during heat periods. I&#x2019;d totally recommend this 100%.&#x201D; -Ilham, [Finding Beautiful](https://findingbeautifulblog.com/)

&#x201C;I used it before. It&#x2019;s cool. My sisters complained about it making them dark at some point.&#x201D; &#x2013; Damilola Adeoye, @adeoyeibukunolu

&#x201C;I once bought it for my ex. She persisted on using it because someone recommended it to her and she wanted to try it out.&#xA0; I thought the cream was overrated though, because I didn&#x2019;t see what&#x2019;s so special about this Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter, and it wasn&#x2019;t cheap then&#x2026; considering that I was still a student, so I managed to buy the small size, at least for a trial and to prove my point that nothing is special in the cream.

Oh boy!

I was wrong&#x2026; in the space of two weeks of using the cream, I saw the difference in her, I can&#x2019;t really be specific but I know she looked better overall. Smooth face and smooth skin&#x2026; she&#x2019;s a dark babe&#x2026;so the dark became lovely.

&#x2026;and that&#x2019;s how we subscribed for the cream, from the small size to the bigger one.&#x201D; &#x2013; Olubunmi Samuel, @gospelredefined

&#x201C;I love cocoa butter creams&#x2019; smell.&#x201D;- Olubunmi Mabel, @olubunmimabel

&#x201C;I have been using it for 12 years now. I love the chocolatey fragrance and how it feels on the skin. It fades scars and stretch marks over time too and because I go without makeup these days, I just use it as a lip balm and it makes my lips supple and soft. I should be made an Ambassador&#x201D; Feyi, @chocolatefeyi

&#x201C;The Palmers cocoa butter I used was years back, about 9 years ago for stretch marks and it was soooooo effective,in weeks every tin had faded off&#x201D; &#x2013; @julezhairlinerz

&#x201C;I have used it once before and it worked for me. However, i used it with a shear oil that time and it made my skin really glow and soft. The fragrance is heavenly but it made me sweat, i remember i used to put it in the fridge then. Lol&#x2026;.but i got another one about a week ago.&#x201D; &#x2013; @_dorjah

&#x201C;@estheradeniyisblog, I met @chocolatefeyi 11yrs and that fragrance stood her out. You should see her skin! Supple and healthy. She&#x2019;s the reason I started using Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter oil 2yrs ago and I remember her each morning when I open it. @palmersuk this is your most loyal customer in Nigeria&#x201D; &#x2013; @irominiabiodun

&#x201C;Arrrrgggh. My love for this cream tho. It&#x2019;s thick but not greasy, makes the skin feel soft and smooth. The chocolate aroma is everything!!! You could almost lick it. Too bad there a lot of fakes out here. So I had to switch.&#x201D; &#x2013; @mz_riene

&#x201C;Love it. Was the first body lotion that improved my skin tone. Still, love it any day anytime&#x201D; &#x2013; Ife, @sheisnaturallybronze

&#x201C;I used Palmer&#x2019;s lotion and I must say I loved how it made my skin feel and smell&#x2026; except that I sweat a lot and every cocoa butter formula made me sweat. So I had to drop it and go for another lotion. I still sweat but yes it&#x2019;s really good. I guess my skin would have improved if I hadn&#x2019;t sweat out the formula before it did its work. Still a great product&#x201D; Becky, @mobaby

&#x201C;Yay, my cream! I like it. It&#x2019;s a good product. It really helps me in healing when I had chicken pox. Didn&#x2019;t change my skin color. I use it up to date even here in America. I love the smell too. &#x201C;@chief_boye

&#x201C;It&#x2019;s perfect. The smell makes me sleep well too&#x201D; &#x2013; @msokeng

&#x201C;I have and it was really nice the smell, the feel and effect was on point but money will not let me be great&#x201D; @vickiealfa

### Review: Palmer&#x2019;s Cocoa Butter Formula by Reva M

## **Palmer&#x2019;s Cocoa Butter Price**

Honestly, when I first bought Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter then, it was around 1,500 Naira. Now, Palmer&#x2019;s Cocoa butter costs 3,500 Naira &#x2013; 5,000 Naira depending on the store and from where you buy it online.

It is cheaper to buy it in stores, be sure to buy from a store that has a history of selling original and quality products. If you are not sure if you will be getting original Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter, you may as well just go buy it online.

Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter [costs 4,300 Naira on Jumia](http://c.jumia.io/?a=35607&amp;c=11&amp;p=r&amp;E=kkYNyk2M4sk%3d&amp;ckmrdr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumia.com.ng%2Fpalmers-cocoa-butter-formula-with-vitamin-e-palmers-mpg211087.html&amp;utm_source=cake&amp;utm_medium=affiliation&amp;utm_campaign=35607&amp;utm_term=). Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter is [within the range of 3,900 Naira to 5,000 Naira on Konga](https://www.konga.com/product/palmers-cocoa-butter-formula-body-cream-3326525?k_id=palacedaughter). The prices vary because it depends on the seller, specific type of cocoa butter and the quantity of the product.

Some of the containers have a 30% bonus inscribed on them. Some have the &#x201C;dry skin therapy&#x201D; inscription, some have the daily skin therapy&#x201D; inscription. Some of the containers are just the plain Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter formula body cream.

Truth is that the difference between all of them are not very much but you can pick based on what you would like to have or you think will be best for great skin results the most.

No, Palmer&#x2019;s cocoa butter does not lighten the skin. I know that different people react to products in different ways but generally, this product does not lighten your skin.

I strongly advise against using this product on your face because naturally, cocoa butter can clog your pores and cause you to have acne. You don&#x2019;t want to use it on your face.
