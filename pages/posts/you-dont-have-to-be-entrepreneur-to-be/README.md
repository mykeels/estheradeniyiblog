Smart Money Woman by Arese Ugu gave me another perspective to seeing the career life as a woman. While I would love to end up an online entrepreneur, I see the constant undermining of women at the office and organized work places.

Entrepreneurship knowledge is on the increase and that is just about another great way to free us from the shackles of financial bondage in a country where graduates are aimlessly roaming about. While this is commendable, I see the need to begin to celebrate building a career in the organized workplace.

You don&#x2019;t have to be an entrepreneur to be successful, celebrated or [financially fit](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/financial-fitness-in-2016). It doesn&#x2019;t always have to be entrepreneurship and personal business to climb to the top in your career. If you have chosen a path in a field, in an industry, in a niche, you can climb up the ladder to the top. You can trump your way to the top. Don&#x2019;t forget that you can have your [side hustle](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/2016/05/why-you-need-side-hustle_11.html) as an entrepreneurial setup.

Read what Evelyn Oluwole writes on&#xA0;[Bella Naija](https://www.bellanaija.com/2017/08/evelyn-oluwole-can-take-world-without-entrepreneur/)

&#x201C;With the power of social
 media, there is an underlining expectation to become an entrepreneur. You are
 celebrated when you say you have your own business and you are deemed a brave
 person for &#x2018;taking the risk&#x2019;. And that may very well be true, but I feel we
 don&#x2019;t celebrate those who work for employers enough.

In a world where we see only part of the
 journey, the desires to become an entrepreneur is the standard, but what about
 working for a company. Why is the journey up that ladder overlooked?

Here are my tips on taking over the world whilst
 working for a company

**Deliver&#xA0;**

At your interview, you promised you would deliver, so make sure that is your
 priority every day. As you walk out of the office every day, ask yourself:
 &#x2018;*have I worked my hardest today*?&#x2019;
 If not, pull your weight and get better.

&#xA0;

**Be a
 solution generator**

It is so easy to identify the problems, but senior management is looking for
 people who will bring solutions to the table. Be that person &#x2013; because that
 person is the next in line to be promoted.

&#xA0;

**Network
 at lunchtime**

Oh, I know that feeling, you have been busy in the last 3 hours and you just
 want to eat a sandwich, check your feed and go back to work. NO! You have got
 to get around the building, get to know people and not just from your
 department. Be concerned about the overall business.

&#xA0;

**Do more&#xA0;**

Yes, I know your job description says you must do this but what about getting
 involved in other things. After all you want a senior position down the line,
 so it&#x2019;s actually crucial that you get involved in other aspects of the
 business.

&#xA0;

**Read more
 industry articles**

You need to know what is affecting your company and the industry at large so
 you have an informed opinion and can effectively contribute. There is so much
 knowledge on the Internet, get browsing.

&#xA0;

**Build a
 relationship with your skip manager**

That is your manager&#x2019;s manager! Why? Because they know the future of your
 manager and if you want to get higher then you need to have a rapport with the
 people that matter.

&#xA0;

**Pay it
 forward&#xA0;**

I cannot stress this enough. There are so many people wanting to be in your
 position. Help them up and watch someone else help you higher!

&#xA0;

**Take
 advantage of training**

Engage with the learning and development department on training. If there isn&#x2019;t
 anything relevant for you, then ask for it and demonstrate why it would make
 your role better. You must invest in you, and so should your employer. Take
 advantage of it!

&#xA0;

**Smile**

Never forget that people buy people. Be approachable and engage with people &#x2013;
 from the cleaner to the CEO.

&#xA0;

**Get a
 Mentor**

We all know that this is important but very few of us do it. A mentor can help
 your career growth is so many ways from learning how to be a better worker,
 understanding the politics within the company, learning the challenges so that
 you can be the solution. The list is endless. Let this be the first thing you
 do this week; and don&#x2019;t worry, a leader would never refuse to be a mentor! &#x201C;
