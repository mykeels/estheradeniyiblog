## Google Analytics

![Google analytics dashboard screenshot](images\Google-analytics-dashboard-screenshot.png)

If by now, you still don&#x2019;t have [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) installed on your blog, it&#x2019;s a little bit disappointing. In fact, not especially if you have been blogging for a long time. Newbies are allowed to slip up on this.

Google Analytics will help you analyze how much traffic is coming in from different channels and since we are concerned about SEO, organic traffic is what we are concerned about here.

You can also get to see the keywords people are typing on search engines to gain entry to your blog. Keywords are search queries in form of words, phrases or sentences that people type into Google and any other search engine like Bing, Yandex, Ask etc.

I use Google Analytics app as it is very easy for me to track my page visits with just an open.

**How to create a Google Analytics account**

- Go to Google analytics sign up page and sign in. If you don&#x2019;t have a Google Analytics account, you might want to create one.
- Click Access Google Analytics and then click on &#x201C;sign up&#x201D; afterwards.
- Fill in the following details &#x2013; your Account Name, Website Name, Website URL, and select an Industry Category and Reporting Time Zone.
- Under Data Sharing Options, you can check the boxes next to the options that you want.
- From the Google Analytics Terms of Service Agreement that opens, click &#x201C;I Accept&#x201D;.
- Add the Tracking ID that is generated to your WordPress or Blogspot Blog
- I would be glad to help out with any issue you have during registration.

## Google Search Console
![Google Search Console dashboard](images\Google-Search-Console.png)A screenshot of my Google Search Console
[Google search console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) is another free SEO tool for Bloggers. I call it your site&#x2019;s Doctor. This tool helps to check out for errors of varying kinds to make sure that your site is accessible online.

With Google Search Console, you also have access to so many information Google Analytics does not even have. With Google Analytics, you cannot find all of the keywords through which people gain entry to your blog. This is one very annoying flaw of Google Analytics.

With Google Search Console, you can find all of this. You can even find search queries people type to find each URL. With Google Search Console, you can check out who is linking to your site. You can submit your sitemap and also submit your new blog post for immediate crawling and indexing. I talked about that here, you can check out how to get Google to quickly index a newly published article

## SEMRush

![SEMRUSH home page screenshot](images\SEMRush.png)

[SEMRush](https://www.semrush.com/) is by far one of the most powerful SEO tools for Bloggers. It comes with a free and paid version. If you are within a budget, SEMRush can serve as a free SEO tool for you.

With SEMRush, you can spy on your competition, see what they are doing and writing about. You can even check from where they are getting their backlinks.

With SEMRush, you can analyze just about any blog or website relative to yours. The downside of the free version of SEMRush is that you have only 10 queries to run per day. This might be a little bit limiting if you have big goals. Not only that, results from your queries are limited to a certain amount.

Like I mentioned, if you are on a budget, you can still make use of SEMRush and find what you need.

## MOZ

![MOZ- domain authority](images\MOZ-domain-authority.png)

[MOZ](http://moz.com/) is the father of Domain Authority. The DA you popularly hear being thrown around is a system developed by MOZ to compare websites and their individual capacities to rank in search engines. DA is on a scale of 0 to 100, where a site with perfect DA has 100. The farther right you are on the scale, the better.

With MOZ you can check your DA and that of other sites. It&#x2019;s funny how not only a site&#x2019;s traffic is used to measure it. There are so many other metrics including DA, engagement, niche, size, etc&#x2026;

MOZ is a free SEO tool for Bloggers who would also like to check their backlink profile.

You can also install MOZ as a toolbar for you to access different sites just in your Google Search Results. very easy.

See this : [SEO may be killing your blog though](https://estheradeniyi.com/seo-is-killing-your-blog/)

By the way, a new Domain Authority is coming soon and I think this is a move to weed off the spamming system that has gone on for too long in this sphere. I would like to write a full post on what&#x2019;s to come and how to prepare your blog for it. In the meantime, if you are able to go through, [check here for full details](https://moz.com/domain-authority-2.0).

## Keywords Everywhere
![Keywords Everywhere Google Chrome Extension](images\free-SEO-tools.png)This is what Keywords everywhere brought out for &#x201C;free SEO tools&#x201D;
This is a Google Chrome extension every single Blogger should have. It is an SEO tool that is absolutely free! With Keywords Everywhere, you get to see how many people are searching for a particular keyword per month.

I believe Keywords Everywhere to be easier and more accurate than SEMRush and other tools when it comes to keyword research. You not only see how many people are searching for the main keyword, you see how many are searching for similar keywords.

## Yoast
![Free SEO tool - Yoast](images\Yoast.png)Screenshot of this post on Yoast plugin
Yoast is even though a WordPress plugin an excellent SEO tool for Bloggers who are keen on on-site optimization.

With Yoast, you can know what you are doing right or wrong or what you are not doing enough on your site.

Yoast is your SEO guide and you have a large chunk of the services for free. If you are on Blogger, you can&#x2019;t install plugins. So you might not have access to Yoast.

## Google Trends

![Google trends](images\Google-trends.png)

[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) is an excellent free SEO tool for Bloggers who would like to tap from free Google traffic. With Google trends, you know what is trending right now or within a closer time frame.

You can select this for different regions too. Google Trends is exceptionally great for news, music, entertainment and movie blogs. Just for free, you know what&#x2019;s going on and what you should be tapping into.

## Google PageSpeed Insights

![Google pagespeed insights](images\Google-PageSPeed-insights.png)

[Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) allows you to check your site speed and know how good it is on different devices. Your site speed is important and can affect your rankings on search engines. In fact, Google specifically lists site speed as a ranking factor.

All you have to do is type in your URL or the URL of any site you want to spy on and the tool will check out your loading time and performance. It will also give you suggestions on how to improve your site.

Other alternatives are [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/) and [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/).

## Keywordtool.io

![Keyword tool](images\Keyword-tool.png)

This is another excellent free SEO tool for Bloggers. With it, you have a lot of keyword ideas based on a single keyword.

After doing proper keyword research and determining if you want to write on it or not, go to [keywordtool.io](http://keywordtool.io) and insert the main keyword.

It will generate hundreds of long-tail keyword opportunities. These are keywords you should add in different places of your article to optimize if for search engines. You don&#x2019;t want to keep repeating your main keyword though. That may result in keyword stuffing.

With other long tail keywords in place, you rank for as many keyword variations as possible.

Other free SEO tools that are like keywordtool.io are &#x2013; [Answer the Public](https://answerthepublic.com/),&#xA0;[Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)

## SEO Analyzer

This is an excellent free SEO tool for Bloggers by Neil Patel. With [SEO Analyzer](https://neilpatel.com/seo-analyzer/) you can check out how well you are doing with your site&#x2019;s SEO.

Not everyone can afford an SEO Specialist or&#xA0; Analyst, I get. With tools that crawl your page for errors and suggestion for fixes, you might get away with not employing one. You have to know however that these are not going to be as in-depth as a specialist would do for you but it&#x2019;s something to start with if you are on a budget.
