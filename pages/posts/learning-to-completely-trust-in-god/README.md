Of recent, a friend was chatting with me online and then we got to the part where I started to tell him how I&#x2019;ve been busy with [JOYA Academy](http://www.instagram.com/joyaxclusive), working on the training that would hold this month and he told me that I have not been looking like myself and that I should do something for him: Switch off my data connection, relax and listen to music or watch TV for 30 minutes. My reflex response was, &#x201C;Haaa! &#x201D; It felt risky for me to relax for &#x2018;that long&#x2019;.&#xA0; The funny part is that I was not working in the real sense of it; the work was happening in my mind &#x2013; I was worrying &#x2013; no one has paid for the training!

Of course I tried to listen to my friend but I just couldn&#x2019;t keep calm until I heard &#x201C;At the mention&#x201D; by Brian and Jenny Johnson (you should download it).&#xA0; It kept me thinking about who really should be doing the worrying &#x2013; God or myself?

Isaiah 26:3 says Thou wilt keep&#xA0;him&#xA0;in [perfect peace](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/peace-reward-of-trusting-christgirl),&#xA0;whose&#xA0;mind&#xA0;is&#xA0;stayed&#xA0;on thee: because he trusteth in thee.

To trust is to be confident in,&#xA0; to be careless about, to be secured in (God). I have discovered that the reason why we struggle with depending on God is because we are yet to understand what really is our responsibility in our faith. People,&#xA0; it is not your responsibility to provide for yourself; it is God&#x2019;s!

Listen to what Jesus said in Matthew 6:30-32

30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
 31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
 32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

Can we kindly stop giving ourselves unnecessary high blood pressure because we think God can mistakenly sleep off and forget to come through for us in our times of need?

Things will cause us to worry: our future,&#xA0; who will pay for our goods and service, our children,&#xA0; spouse, work,&#xA0; the security situation in the country, even the safety of the food we buy in the market. These things are legitimate believe me but, trusting God is made easy when we simply understand our role and God&#x2019;s role in our life.

Your role is to do your best as a human, His is to bless, deliver, preserve, provide, protect and cause the increase as God. Meditate upon the anchor scripture (Isaiah 26:3) as well as other related scriptures and watch yourself de-stressing and enjoying all round good health. Your brain is meant for imaginations and creativity, not for worry.

Let&#x2019;s do this right; let&#x2019;s[ trust God](http://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/7-daily-steps-to-trust-in-the-lord-with-all-your-heart.html) and &#x201C;Be still and know that I am God&#x201D;(Psalm 46:10). Now, breath in&#x2026;And breath out!
