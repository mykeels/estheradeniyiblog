**Aladdin** is your feel-good comedy. If you are adamant to change, you might feel otherwise especially if you have seen the previous Aladdin. This adaptation of Disney&#x2019;s animated Aladdin is vibrant and beautiful. Seen the trailer yet?

## Aladdin Movie synopsis

![](images\Aladdin-genie.jpg)

Aladdin is a popular street thief who meets Jasmine, the princess of Agrabah who they have not seen in a while. During Aladdin&#x2019;s quest to win her heart, he comes in contact with a magic oil lamp in which a genie is entrapped. Aladdin and the genie become friends and their adventurous friendship is handy to stop Jafar from ruining the kingdom.

## Conclusion

Aladdin was a comfortable movie to watch. If you are looking to have a good laugh, you will be satisfied. I would like to juxtapose Aladdin 2019 with that of 1992 as soon as it is off the cinema. I also have a couple of lessons and favorite quotes I would love to share.
