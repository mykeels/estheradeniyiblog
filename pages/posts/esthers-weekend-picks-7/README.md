> [Onigbese people oooo!!!. I was on @sisi_yemmie &#x2018;s when I stumbled on this again. I remember when she made this post. I was just doing &#x2018;tell them oh, tell them oh, awon ayawo ma da pada, tell them oh&#x2019;. I watched it yesterday again and I was screaming the same thing &#x1F602;. When they want to borrow money from you, they will be doing like heaven has neglected them and the windows have been shut. In your own good mind, you will quickly transfer the money. Oya auntie, return na, wahala. If you have any trick you use to collect your money back, please share with us o.

7. This reader&#x2019;s comment on [my 5 AM post](https://estheradeniyi.com/waking-up-at-5-am-literally-changed-my-life/) was very heartwarming.

&#x201C;*Are you from Nigeria? Why is everyone I meet from Nigeria so happy! So smiling! In a most contagious way. And always SO intelligent! I have read your piece about getting up at 5 AM. I am hoping this will be what I need to finally accomplish this elusive goal! If it does the trick I will be so grateful. I know my life will change so positively. I will be in touch!*&#x201D;
