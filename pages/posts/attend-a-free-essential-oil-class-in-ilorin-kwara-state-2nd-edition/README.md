We launched our first **free essential oil class**[here in Ilorin](https://estheradeniyi.com/free-essential-oil-classes-in-ilorin/) on the 7th of September and it was splendid. This is why we are looking to have a second edition on the 1st of October, 2019.&#xA0;

I was introduced to essential oils in a grand style and to be honest with you, there was no better way to have begun my oily journey. I say this because I quickly had access to the resources I needed to get me started quickly. These resources were enough to appreciate the sweet-smelling content of these tiny bottles.&#xA0;

I am as a result very passionate about helping people properly understand these oils and how to use them responsibly. My aim is to expose you to all that you need to know about essential oils so that you can begin to use them in your day to day living for health, skincare, hair health and so many other things you will discover in the class.&#xA0;

It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you have never heard of essential oils before, are a complete beginner or you have been on the oily journey for years. This class will also be useful for you if you formulate skincare, hair care products, and perfumes.&#xA0;

## Here are the things we will cover in this class:

- What are essential oils?
- How are essential oils produced?
- What can essential oils do for us; how to use the common essential oils.
- How to identify fake essential oils and where to buy original essential oils.

Below are details of the class
