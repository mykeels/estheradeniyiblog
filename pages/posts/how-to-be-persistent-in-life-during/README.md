[![Persistence](images/weightlifting.jpg)](images/weightlifting.jpg)

 Life is full of ups and downs. Understanding that it is not
 a Santa&#x2019;s package every time is key. Inasmuch as we know that we cannot help
 some challenging situations from coming our way,&#xA0; persistence is strictly key. Backing down at
 every difficult cross road won&#x2019;t get anybody anywhere. There will be thorns and
 bristles ; cakes and cherries.&#xA0; There
 will be medals and awards ; adversity and opposition. Everybody has had to go
 through the good and the bad times. When you are at that stage where you&#xA0; feel like giving up,&#xA0; how can you still remain persistent? How can
 you follow up on our dreams still and not give up on our goals?

 Understand That [Everybody Goes Through the Difficult Times&#xA0;](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/are-you-currently-burned-out-pause)

 Everybody has had to deal with dreams not coming through and
 goals not been accomplished. Everybody has had times when they only wanted to
 give up and not move on ahead. Many of the notable people in Life experienced challenges. Thomas Edison went through over ten thousand prototypes before being able to develop a commercially viable light bulb. Now, &#xA0;that&#x2019;s some persistence for you! Over ten thousand times!&#xA0;

 Remember that it is only a Phase

 Problems usually pass with time. Always remember this and
 you imagine your challenges as that bitter drug with an expiry date. At that
 same time the following year or month or week or even day,&#xA0; you may realize that that difficult situation
 is not currently what you have to deal with anymore,&#xA0; you are on to something else. Persisting and
 keeping up during that difficult time is therefore going to be a plus. Tough
 times don&#x2019;t last,&#xA0; tough people do.

 Turn to someone For Help&#xA0;

 This isn&#x2019;t codependency like people think. We all need
 someone around us. Everybody need someone more knowledgeable,&#xA0; more experienced,&#xA0; more mature or more courageous. If your
 current challenge is something someone else has gone through or you think would
 understand,&#xA0; why not seek the person&#x2019;s
 help or advice? Don&#x2019;t give up already, stay persistent.

 Draw up Reasonable, Practical Solutions&#xA0;

 Now you can look at your challenges and come up with a plan.
 Everyone needs a plan after all. Stick with yourself, be persistent and be
 realistic. Look up solutions on the Internet, in a book or ask a friend for
 help and walk through this tough time.

 To be successful in life,&#xA0;
 you need persistence. [Be patient](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/are-you-currently-burned-out-pause),&#xA0;
 plan,&#xA0; pray and be persistent and
 everything will be just fine.
