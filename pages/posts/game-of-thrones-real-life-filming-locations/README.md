Now let&#x2019;s talk filming location. The show is filmed in different parts of the world, which are now tourist attraction sites, due to the large and widely acclaimed nature and followership of the series.

Winterfell, being one of the most popular settings of the movie is home to one of the most popular families; the Starks. A huge chunk of the narrative is centered on various members of this family, and they play a huge role in the telling of the tale. Winterfell is set in Doune Castle, a medieval stronghold near the village of Doune, in the Stirling district of central Scotland.

## Iron Islands- Murlough Bay, Northern Ireland

The Iron Islands, home of the GreyJoys, one of the seven kingdoms and home seat of the salt throne. This is another location that was key in the telling of the GOT tale and is set in Murlough Bay in Nortern Ireland. Murlough Bay is known for its outstanding beauty and remote location.

## Dothraki Sea- Glens Of Antrim, Northern Ireland

The Dothraki sea is a large (as in, extra extra extensive) expanse of tall blades of grass that mark the beginning of the Dothraki territory, a tribe of savage horse riders who are known for their great skills in battle.

Their addition to the plot of the tale makes for a very spicy side dish, and adds colour to the story. The &#x201C;sea&#x201D; is set in the Glens of Antrim. Known locally as simply The Glens, it is a region of County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It comprises nine glens (valleys), that radiate from the Antrim Plateau to the coast. The Glens are an area of outstanding natural beauty and are a major tourist attraction in north Antrim.

So, if you do decide to take a vacation, you may as well consider one of these sites as they now have a double dose of history backing them. Consider cheap flights and an awesome travel experience with [Travelstart Nigeria.](http://www.travelstart.com.ng)

You will do well to see the movie series first though, just so you have enough background knowledge to truly understand and appreciate what you see and hear there.
