In the year 1990, 28 years ago, **Lekki Conservation Centre, a Natural Resource Conservation in Lekki,** Lagos State, was established. It was built by the Chevron Corporation for the **Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF)**. It is a 78-hectare expanse of land.

**Lekki Conservation Centre** is one of the most sought-after hangout, relaxation and fun spots in Lagos state. We don&#x2019;t know if this has anything to do with the fact that it has the longest canopy walkway in the whole of Africa but it is definitely a factor.

Rarely does anyone go to Lekki Conservation Centre without returning with pictures of them in the canopy walkway. Well, this is asides from the giant, live games area and fun spots people take photoshoots at.

You can&#x2019;t miss the scenery and Instagram worthy environment of the Lekki Conservation Centre. LCC is that very first hangout spot many Lagosians think of when they think of fun. Who wouldn&#x2019;t?

An experience at LCC is worth it. The average Nigerian needs time away from the hustle and bustle of Lagos once in a while.

If what I have to do to escape loud horns and incessant cursing from drivers and passengers is get to a more relaxed environment, I would choose Lekki Conservation Centre. At least, it is a more coordinated kind of bustle in there. Everyone has a common goal- to have fun.
