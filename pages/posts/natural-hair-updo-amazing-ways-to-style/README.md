[Natural Hair](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/search/label/Natural%20Hair)is so beautiful. There are so many ways we can style them especially when they grow out. One of the popular styles now is the Updo. I like it because it is convenient and easy to do. Well, that depends on the type of style. Worthy of note is that you can make them even at home by yourself. Check out these amazing ways to style your natural hair and see which you can pick from.

1. This neatly weaved hair can be rocked anytime any day.

2. After completing weaving the sides, &#xA0;you can leave the ends free and tie them into an updo like this one.
 R 3. There is definitely some extension in this updo but it turns out superb.

4. This one is an everyday style you can flawlessly rock to anywhere. And it is just as easy as neatly packing up your hair and securing it with a rubber band or pins.
