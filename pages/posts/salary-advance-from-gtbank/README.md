**Salary advance from GTBank** and a lot more other banks is one of the best immediate financially relieving schemes I have ever seen.

These days a lot of financial relief programs like loan apps are springing up and I just find them really helpful even though they sometimes have repercussions that are not too pleasant e.g high-interest rates. I think this is where GTbank salary advance is such a good one to try out.

One of these financial relief programs is the recent invent on loan apps in Nigeria. They are proliferating by the second. Paylater, Branch, Palm Credit, KiaKia, Aella Credit, Fair Money, just mention. They are a whole lot now.

[I recently did a review of Paylater app, it was an honest review](https://estheradeniyi.com/my-paylater-app-review/), a step-by-step guide of how it works and every other important information you would like to have on your fingertips.

This is why I think all of these schemes and innovations are really cool. Having to borrow money from a friend can be downright embarrassing. Getting into an unexpected financially tight corner is already as depressing as it can be. Having to face a friend who would probably judge you, or not, is another.

With **GTBank salary advance** and in fact, all of the other salary advance schemes by various banks in Nigeria, I don&#x2019;t see the survival of those loan apps with ridiculous interest rates. I mean, a lot of them are downright preposterous, very inconsiderate.

One of the other nice benefits of GTBank&#x2019;s salary advance is that you don&#x2019;t need a collateral to get funded.

So, when I heard of the Gtbank&#x2019;s Salary advance scheme, I decided to try it out. I mean, if I must write on it, I should probably have a good first-hand experience yea?

## What is the GTBank salary advance scheme about?

GTBank salary advance allows you to have up to 50% of your monthly salary as an advance to attend to your urgent financial needs.

## What you need to be eligible for GTBank Salary Advance

1. Your salary account must be with Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank).

I have never worked in any organization that didn&#x2019;t prefer GTBank over other banks to pay salaries in. I don&#x2019;t know the rationale behind that and what goes on as regards this but I would like to think this has helped me in various ways as my primary bank account is with GTBank.

2. The Minimum monthly salary for an employee in the public sector (Government) must be 25, 000 Naira while in the private sector must be 50, 000 Naira

3. You cannot lend an amount that exceeds your salary after an addition of 50% to it. For example, If you earn 50,000 Naira monthly, You can only lend a maximum of 75,000 Naira

4. The maximum payback time is 365 Days which I think is great as it would give you time to get yourself back together.

5. Reserved interest rate chargeable on the Borrower&#x2019;s account shall be the Bank&#x2019;s prime lending rate from time to time and it will be charged on all amounts owed by the borrower.

On 35,000 Naira, for example, 700 Naira was deducted as Salary advance commission and 35.00 Naira was deducted as Salary Advance VAT. Also, 20:00 Naira was deducted as Salary Advance Access Charge. This is basically all that will be deducted and that is immediately

**UPDATE #1**

I am updating this today, January 15, 2019.

Salary advance was repaid two months ago. I was not able to repay with the USSD code so I reported to the customer care.

Apparently, the product is new, so they have not been able to make repayment of the Gtbank salary advance work just yet. I was given access to my bank account officers, I contacted them and they did the manual deduction from their end.
