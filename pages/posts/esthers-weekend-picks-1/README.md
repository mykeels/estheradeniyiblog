Since it is the season of launching brand new things, speaking of [The Weekend Blogging Forum](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-weekend-blogging-forum-episode-1/)&#x2026;

**Esther&#x2019;s Weekend Picks** is the advanced version of [Weekend Links](https://estheradeniyi.com/tag/weekend-links/). I feel so bad that I deleted a lot of them because I felt they were no more necessary. Plus I was having issues with expired pages and I didn&#x2019;t want links constituting a nuisance to my blog. If they must be there, they&#x2019;ve got to be working.

Esther&#x2019;s Weekend Picks will be everything. Favorite weekend links, products I tried and absolutely loved, videos I won&#x2019;t stop watching, pictures that made it to my soul and just about anything else I genuinely loved during the week.

These are my faves this week:

1. Satin Facial Scrub by Young Living

I should do a separate review of this. The granules are so gentle and effective

2. Funke Akindele Bello&#x2019;s second chance in life

3. The [Five Nigerian Love Language](https://jesusandjollof.simplecast.com/episodes/the-five-nigerian-love-languages-episode-c3e5f8df)s on Jesus and Jollof Podcast

These women are not really well at all. Whoever agreed to put them both in the same room is the enemy.

4. Olivia Sose&#x2019;s feature of this [brilliant Portharcourt entrepreneur](http://www.oliviasose.com/2019/04/eggshells-new-oil.html?m=1) is heartwarming

5. Please wake me up! Who is [importing Pizza](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv88yaYgMkC/) from the UK?

6. &#x2018;[More than Gold](https://estheradeniyi.com/more-than-gold-by-judith-kanayo/)&#x2018; by Judikay won&#x2019;t stop playing in my head.

7. This native bathtub by @nativetrails is a whole mood.

8. &#x201C;I got my own back.&#x201D; Maya Angelou

9. [Wendy Okolo](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6517730038820020224), a 30-year old Igbo lady becomes the first black woman to have a Ph.D. in aircraft engineering

P.S &#x2013; ouch! Your crush is a [Yoruba demon](https://estheradeniyi.com/identify-yoruba-demon/).
