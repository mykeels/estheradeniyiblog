 Online businesses have been misunderstood by propsects and even advocators severally. The misconceptions about online businesses have not only misled newbies but misguided them on the path to success online.

I was going through my Instagram feed when I found this (via @entrepreneursnook) and to me, this is an exact summary of what I would advise anyone that is launching a business online or has been with it and is struggling.

Read below:
 ____
 &#x201C;1. You can&#x2019;t start your online for free.99 all day, every day and expect stellar results. The free options can only take you so far, at some point you&#x2019;d need to invest in tools to uplevel your business. While you might be able to get a website for free, it is not likely to come across as a professional website. There is some cost associated with starting your online business.

Think domain name, website, hosting and possibly getting a web designer. We haven&#x2019;t talked about some of the productivity or tech tools that you would need. These days tools are subscription based that are billed either monthly or annually.
 ____

2. Yes, passion is great and that&#x2019;s a good way to get started but in addition to passion, you need the right strategies to get started. You need a plan for your business, you need to know what works and what doesn&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;ve got to acquire some business acumen. Passion can turn to profit when combined with the proper knowledge of your industry.

Don&#x2019;t run your business on passion alone, be business savvy too!

____

3. While I believe that creating efficiency in your business is key I strongly disagree that your business can successfully run on autopilot ( any fact checkers to correct me?). I believe in automation and using it for repetitive tasks HOWEVER, your business needs YOU.

You are the &#x2018;IT&#x2019; factor, therefore canned responses and autoresponders should be used as a way to acknowledge a customer&#x2019;s inquiry but not as a communication tool.

Automating majority of your business activities right from day one doesn&#x2019;t give you the opportunity to be hands-on in your business. Grow with your business, automate as you grow.&#x201D;

What are the misconceptions you have always had about launching an online business? What is your online business about? Tell me &#x2019;bout it.
