Oh well, fun options in Ilorin are becoming limitless by the day. Speaking of **Domino&#x2019;s Pizza, Ilorin**, you can have some more [fun spots to enjoy](https://estheradeniyi.com/fun-places-to-visit-in-ilorin/) intercontinental snacks and fun meals.

I am back to Kwara state! I know that this isn&#x2019;t something I have officially announced on the blog just yet and this is because even the few people I told that I am now in Kwara state are wondering why the heck anyone leaves Lagos to settle down in Kwara. News flash, I do! Lol.

Kwara state is a slower town, I get it. [Fun spots in Ilorin](https://estheradeniyi.com/fun-places-to-visit-in-ilorin/) are so limited, I get it. Moving back here comes with a price, I get it all. I, however, do not have to be stuck for 2 hours in traffic for a 30-minute bus ride. I also do not have to bother about the ridiculously expensive rates of everything in that city.

I am not into metropolitan cities that suck the life out of you. You know, your success is not tied to Lagos state. I finally said it and it feels very good. You honestly, sincerely, do not need to be positioned in Lagos to make sense of your life. You can succeed anywhere, in Lagos or anywhere.

Okay, Domino&#x2019;s Pizza, the good news of the month!

**Domino&#x2019;s Pizza (and Cold Stone Creamery)** has been headlong buzzing ever since its launch last month. They began operations on the 27th of May, 2019 and to celebrate its launch, [they gave the first 50 people](https://twitter.com/dominosng/status/1132991250234335232/photo/1) who came around FREE PIZZAS!

I wish there are enough competitors because I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to walk in last night. It was too busy for comfort.

If you would like to check out the new **Domino&#x2019;s Pizza outlet in Ilorin**, you can find it in Kwara mall. It is the first spot positioned by the left-hand wing when you walk into the mall.

**The Kwara mall** is also known as The Palms Shopping Mall and this is on Fate road, Ilorin, beside NTA, Kwara.

I am not so sure Domino&#x2019;s pizza in Ilorin has home delivery yet. That would be an awesome idea though. I mean, delivered pizza is the best pizza, just saying. If you are interested in having the price list, you can [check out this article](https://estheradeniyi.com/dominos-pizza-nigeria/) for all the prices of food items on the menu.
