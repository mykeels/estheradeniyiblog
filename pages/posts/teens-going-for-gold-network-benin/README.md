**Teens Going for Gold Network is set for Benin after #TeachATeen 2.0 in Ibadan and Lagos.**

As part of the training phase of the 2018 edition of Project Teach a Teen, Teens Going for Gold Network, an organization dedicated to grooming value-driven teenagers to become socially conscious and financially self reliant, has freely privided entreprise education, financial education, and vocational education amongst others to 66 disadvantaged or underserved teenagers.

This year the project which proritizes teenagers vulnerable to crime and poverty, [started in Lagos](https://estheradeniyi.com/teach-a-teen-campaign-2018/). The forty (40) participants in Lagos who were mainly between ages ten to nineteen, were trained on the following topics: Entreprise Education, Financial Literacy, Global Citizenship Education (GCED), Ethical Leadership and Sex Education. The project was implemented in partnership with One African Child Foundation for Creative Learning. All participants were also engaged in vocational classes of their choice. Available classes were Bag Making, Cake Baking and Decoration, Gele tying and Makeup, Making of Soap and Perfume and Web Design.

The [Teach a Teen program was also held in Ibadan](https://estheradeniyi.com/teens-going-for-gold-network-ibadan/) on 6th and 7th August 2018 at Jesus Kids Orphanage. With 26 participants, the Ibadan program was also an outstanding success. From 28th till 30th August 2017, the #TeachATeen train will also be in Benin City at the Edo State Children Remand Home.

This training is a followup to the #TeachATeen campaign that was on throughout the month of June. Founded by 24 year-old Pelumi Obisesan, Teens Going for Gold Network is securing the next generation from poverty and also building active global citizens.
