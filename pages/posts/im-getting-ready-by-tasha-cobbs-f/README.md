[Ga shi nan by Kaestrings&#xA0;](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/ga-shi-nan-by-kaestrings-lyrics)

## [Bridge 1: Nicki Minaj]

Yo, aye yo, beach house vibes maneuver the jetski

&#x2018;Cause-&#x2019;cause I serve the God that parted the red sea

Multi-million dollars commercials for Pepsi

From food-stamps to more ice than Gretzky

I don&#x2019;t gotta talk the Lord defends me

I watch them all fall for going against me

&#x2018;Cause me and all my angels shot the devil up

While you was trying to pull me down I levelled up

I levelled up twice, I levelled up three times

He tapped &#x2019;em and told &#x2019;em &#x201C;she&#x2019;s mine&#x201D;

So even when I cried I knew I&#x2019;d be fine

Prepare for a miracle blessing in these times

Now praise Him, raise Him, name it, claim it

Every tongue that rises up against me, shame it

I breathe success in and out my lungs

I got the power of life and death coming out of my tongue

[Interlude]

Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh

Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh

Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh

Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh

### There has been a lot of [controversy about I&#x2019;m Getting Ready by Tasha Cobbs](https://getuperica.com/43121/tasha-cobbs-fans-react-to-her-song-with-nicki-minaj/).

Some folks believe that it is just not proper to feature an artist as secular as Nicki Minaj. They say that it is a slap on the Gospel itself. If we are going to pass the message of the Good News, we should do this the right way, many people clamour. Nicki Minaj is such a distraction. Some people go as far as attack Tasha Cobbs&#x2019; faith in Christ. &#x201C;She should watch her salvation&#x201D;, someone writes on Social Media.

Read what [Damilola Jonathan Oladeji](about:invalid#zClosurez) had to say:

&#x201C;I have been away a bit and for good reason, so after I post
 my thoughts on Tasha cobbs and NM, kindly resist the urge to come and tell me
 how disappointed you are. Don&#x2019;t call me dear in a reply or use the &#x201C;Dami&#x201D;
 thing on me. This is not about our imagined familiarity, it&#x2019;s about the weird
 inconsistency and false ideas people peddle. It&#x2019;s also a need to help
 Christians like me who struggle with doubts and hope to know what qualifies us
 in our faith.

&#xA0;

I have never been a perfect Christian, to be honest, I have
 messed up a lot and I have also come to realise that messing up is human.
 However, there is this fear I have always learnt to understand. You don&#x2019;t go
 from the bed of fornication into the bed of fellowship with God. Yes we are
 human and we mess up, but if you feel good enough about messing up that you
 don&#x2019;t get worried about carrying your Bible the next minute or standing to
 minister the next minute, then I am scared of you. I am really frightened by
 the idea that I could finish beating up my wife and still climb a pulpit with
 no iota of shame.

&#xA0;

There is always a way to know when I am not in sync with
 God, I lose fellowship and that makes it difficult for me to serve. What is the
 point of my service if it is not going to be backed by fellowship with God?

&#xA0;

Is it just so I can look good and use my talents? I play the
 saxophone but for some time I stopped because church attendance was a sparse
 thing for me. When I go to church these days, I am aware that my attendance is
 not what qualifies me to return to worship and sing but the justification I get
 by faith in Jesus.

&#xA0;

How can you be justified when you cannot even fellowship?

[You might like : Alagbada Ina by Nathaniel Bassey](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/alagbada-ina-by-nathaniel-bassey-lyrics)

&#xA0;

The most painful responses to this, comes from
 &#x201C;Christians.&#x201D; We claim that Jesus sat with Sinners and I do not
 refute that. I dare ask you if Jesus ever called these sinners to service
 without showing them the need for repentance?

&#xA0;

Sinners can attend church and they should not be pushed
 away, we all are sinners and we should have a chance to sit with Jesus but only
 a person who wants to end like Judas would dare to consciously follow after
 their own greed and lust yet still serve as a mouthpiece of God.

&#xA0;

Don&#x2019;t you feel shame when you fall short of God&#x2019;s glory?
 Don&#x2019;t you see the need to separate yourself? Are you telling me Nicki will stop
 writing vulgar lyrics and follow only Christ? Are you saying she is now
 repentant of her promotion of a sex-driven personal brand?

&#xA0;

I am not here to argue about who sins more, the point to be
 made here is that Jesus is not forcing anyone to represent him. I will listen
 to Nicki and not feel guilty because it&#x2019;s her song style, leave it at that. But
 to make it seem like Jesus desperately needs the Minaj brand for the gospel is
 just absurd.

And we Christians that defend these things with such
 arguments, we only end up enslaving ourselves to the world&#x2019;s standards.
 Eventually we make it harder for Christians to stand for anything.

[I go dey by your side by The Voice](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/i-go-dey-by-your-side-voice-theme-song)

I was on a thread yesterday; a teacher at a christian
 preschool was sacked for maintaining a second job as a porn actress. People
 argued that the Christian school was too intolerant and judgemental. We all
 know Jesus would neither watch, patronise or approve porn but we somehow expect
 a school built as a model of his lifestyle to close its eyes to a member of
 their team who acts porn.

&#xA0;

No one should come meet you in the closet of your room to
 stuff Christianity down your throat but as a Christian, I maintain the right to
 say, that alliance with Nicki does not represent Jesus.

&#xA0;

It could be a good jam, I listen to good jams like this
 &#x201C;Babylon&#x201D; track from Tuface and MI but I don&#x2019;t go about deceiving
 myself that the song is some &#x201C;service&#x201D; to God.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

God is not a starved sky daddy, thirsty for any kind of
 service. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: God will not despise a
 broken and contrite heart. Serving while actively chasing your own lust and
 greed only puffs people up, making it hard to come to the God who justifies the
 duly acknowledged ungodly person.&#x201D;

[![Tasha Cobbs](images\TashaCobbs-1024x679.jpg)](images\TashaCobbs-1024x679.jpg)

Others feel that this does not matter one bit as long as the message is still passed. What mattered is that the Gospel is spread. A friend of mine and I chatted on Whatsapp and he had this to say:

&#x201C;Tradition/religion affects Christianity.

Nicky and Tasha are friends. What message would Tasha be
 preaching if she can&#x2019;t accommodate Nicky in her songs?

Who even says Nicky is not born again?

That she doesn&#x2019;t go gospel, does that mean she is of the
 devil?

Some people actually separate their profession totally from
 their faith but we really long for that place where our faith is reflected in
 our profession

As Christians we must be open minded

Those who are worldly are not as hypocritical as those in
 church.

Those in the world are more real than the church people.

The best Actors and Actresses are found in church.

The person who is in the world feels more accepted by the
 world than the people in the church. Church folks are judgmental.

Thank God for people who are challenging the status quo&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 

I remembered when [Sola Allison did that collaboration with Adekunle Gold](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/alujanjankijan-by-sola-allyson-ft), come and see all sort of stupid response on her timeline.

All these holier-than-thou folks are like, why will she
 associate with somebody like that

And I was wondering, who told you &#xA0;are better than Adekunle Gold?

Because he doesn&#x2019;t appear church-ing, those that mean he is
 not saved?

Let&#x2019;s even assume he is not born again, where else is
 darkness suppose to shine than in the dark?

Some people don&#x2019;t have light, If they do, there light should
 shine in the dark.

If you have light you should be able to associate with
 darkness without fear of darkness overcoming your light.

Jesus didn&#x2019;t die so that we can be religion but have life.
 We must take Jesus out of church and into the dark. How Kong are we to limit
 Jesus to the church alone?&#x201C;

&#xA0;
