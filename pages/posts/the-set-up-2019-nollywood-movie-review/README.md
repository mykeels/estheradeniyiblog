**The Set Up** (2019 Nollywood movie) by **Niyi Akinmolayan** is that film that makes me desperately wish I studied something related to film in school but it&#x2019;s all good because, at the end of the day, movies go beyond all of the technicalities and film language.

We will leave all of that to the critics and movie professionals while we talk about these movies in a different light, like the average cinema audience; how the movie made us feel. We need all sides to a story to have a good view of it anyway.

The Set Up was very unexpected, in a fabulous way! Hours before I went to see The Set Up, I turned my back on Nollywood. I was seeing bad Nollywood movies back to back and that just got me really mad.

Just when I thought we raised the bar&#x2026; I completely gave up on anything Nollywood. Maybe I would watch where others were watching but to go buy a ticket to see a Nollywood movie? Nah!

Everything changed when I finally gave in to the pressure to see The Set Up. I had watched tiny snippets here and there. I also saw The Set Up movie trailer but very absentmindedly. I wasn&#x2019;t ready to see it until friends on Instagram and on Whatsapp highly recommended it so I gave it a try.

Fam, I was happy. Oh, you would think that the story alone made me happy. No, everything made me happy. I was happy that we are getting it. I also talked myself into not driving into conclusions hastily. I am happy I gave Nollywood another try.

Before I continue with all of my happy stories, I think you should see the trailer below and then I give all of my opinions. I will try not to spoil this movie for you. So, no spoilers.

## The Set Up Movie Trailer

## The Set Up Movie / The Story

What an interesting story The Set Up is. It was with a lot of twists and turns. At first, the twists were becoming too complicated for me to understand but as they began to unravel the mystery, I fell hopelessly in love.

The Set Up is a brilliant story and you will have to sit tight to properly understand and appreciate the art they poured into it. If you are a lazy movie watcher, The Set Up is not for you.

It will keep you on your toes, wondering what is what and which is which. After every unravel, you&#x2019;d either clap, scream or hiss &#x2013; not at the story but at the revelation. That was a total experience for me because it was refreshing. It was a better story than what I have seen/heard a long time.

## The Acting

Every single actor was perfect for the character. It was a brilliant portioning. It&#x2019;s one thing to have a great story, it is another to have people who can portray and represent the characters as precisely as possible.

The Set Up made sure of that! It was an excellent character to actor match. You see, I must be frank with you, what they pulled in that movie, it was either going to be a hit or miss. You either get it completely right or absolutely wrong. It was the former and I applaud them for this.

[**Adesua Etomi Wellington**](https://estheradeniyi.com/adesua-etomi/), the side I saw of her shows how extremely talented she is. The balance she exhibited between vileness and vulnerability was very admirable. **Joke Silva**, oh my, she was a steller! I do not think they could have picked anyone better for the role.

**My Mide** from [Skinny Girl in Transit](https://estheradeniyi.com/tag/skinny-girl-in-transit/)! **Ayolola Ayoola**. You know, as soon as we saw him, the whole cinema went awwwwwwn. We have developed some sort of fondness for this dude. He can do no wrong in our eyes fam!

I absolutely loved **Dakore Egbuson-Akande**. She was very fun to watch. Aaaaaah, **Tina Mba** was fierce. Jeez. I have always known that she is made of such material but The Set Up proved all that beyond any single iota of doubt.

I am not too familiar with **Kehinde Bankole** but I absolutely loved her acting. Clean and very expressive. I hope to see more of her, she did a very good job.

I am also appeased with the fact that not all Nigerian child actors are poor after all. All of the children were extraordinary.

## The Music

Yes yes yes. Really good transitions, appropriate music, and themes. Perfect. On point!

## What I didn&#x2019;t like

So so so, this may be a little bit of a spoiler. I wish it were not so but there&#x2019;s absolutely no way to talk about this without giving away a little of the movie.

So, there&#x2019;s was a way the movie portrayed Pastors that I didn&#x2019;t like. The movie made it seem as though it is normal and morally okay for a man of God to be sexually involved with a young woman just because they are in love. That movie justified fornication and sexual immorality.

I understand that my sentiments may not be a general turn off but if you ask me, that put me off.

## In conclusion

The Set Up (2019 Nollywood movie) is highly recommended. Maybe a 9/10 for me. If you don&#x2019;t ever see this movie, please be convinced that you missed a complete Nollywood cinematic experience.
