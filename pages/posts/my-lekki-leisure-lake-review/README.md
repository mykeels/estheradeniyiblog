**Lekki leisure lake** was not a Lagos fun spot I thought I would be at in months to come. I had seen some of my friends&#x2019; Tarkwa Bay pictures and looked forward to be there. Then, Secured Ladies showed up. I was going through my Instagram feed when I saw the event. It was supposed to be at **Lekki Leisure Lake**. Time to go out, I thought!

Been an SEO makes you forget other important things like living and having fun. You&#x2019;d be stuck behind your computer for weeks until you are running on empty fun wise. So I thought to myself, today isn&#x2019;t going to totally ruin my career.&#xA0; I was up and at Lekki leisure lake in no time.

I ordered Taxify to get me to Lekki Leisure Lake because I just didn&#x2019;t want to go through the stress of jumping Lagos buses and still ending up asking everyone what the next step is on my journey to Lekki leisure lake. For people who will be boarding public transportation however, I will give a clear description of how to get there.

**![Lekki Leisure Lake](images\IMG_20180526_124327.jpg)**

**Lekki leisure lake address** : Address: Block 1, Plot 3, Okunda Blue Water Tourism Scheme , Lekki, Lagos State. It is opposite Vantage Beach Hotel

If you are coming from the mainland, board a bus going to Obalende. Same as if you are driving. Take Lekki-Ajah from Obalende. If you are coming in your car, get to Lekki first round about and continue along the express. When you get to the second roundabout, take a turn into Remi Oluwude street. At the end of that street,&#xA0; take the first exit at the roundabout. Continue driving until you get to Lekki third roundabout. At this roundabout take the first exit and continue along this road until you get to another roundabout. It&#x2019;s better to ask for the lake at this point. If you are coming in public transport, tell the driver going to Lekki that you are going to Lekki leisure lake.

## Lekki Leisure lake gate fee

The gate fee is almost same as for other beaches and resorts in Lagos. On Saturdays, adults have to pay 1,000 Naira and children get a pass for free. It&#x2019;s quite expensive on Sundays and public holidays because adults pay a sum of 2,000 Naira and children, a sum of 1,000 Naira.

## What I think about Lekki Leisure Lake

The only other beach I have been to is [Elegushi beach](https://estheradeniyi.com/elegushi-beach/) but I have read about many other Lagos beaches. I think Lekki Leisure Lake is dry compared to the other places. There wasn&#x2019;t even any jet boat or something. You practically make fun for yourself here.
![Lekki](images\IMG-20180526-WA0022.jpg)Me forming model. Please don&#x2019;t go to the beach in long gowns, just ignore your girl. *rolls eyes*
The chicken and chips was good however. Oh my, the peppery chicken was all you ever want in chicken. There&#x2019;s good food tho&#x2019;, so if you have some plenty cash to waste on food, you should end up there.

I see the place to be more private than other popular beaches. I bet, it&#x2019;s the most exotic spot for romantic beach experience. Remember I said that you make of it what you want it to be. So an evening picnic, I think, would be very fun at that lake.

## What I don&#x2019;t like about Lekki Leisure Lake

They don&#x2019;t allow you bring your food in. So, the anchor of Secured Ladies is a French girl who&#x2019;s lived in the Caribbean area for a long time. On top of that, she&#x2019;s vegan. She literally had to bring her own food and beg to be allowed to do so.

I don&#x2019;t know if I want to pay gate fee and still have them dictate the food, not especially if I am for picnic. It doesn&#x2019;t make sense to me.

## What to wear to Lekki Leisure Lake

Just like for every other [beach and resort in Lagos](https://estheradeniyi.com/resorts-in-lagos/), go light. Shorts on simple shirts can go for both male and female. You can be funky if you are female and go with some statement beachy wears. A floppy hat and sunshades should boost your morale. Beach bags come in handy so that you are freer and more relaxed.

If you are coming in public transport you should have your beach shorts and light top under a gown or full clothes so that you don&#x2019;t run a risk of being groped or gang attacked in Lagos. If you are taking a ride or coming in your own car, well, you can dress up all you want.

## Other fun things to do at Lekki Leisure Lake

1. Organize a mini birthday party

2. Do a [public-private proposal](https://estheradeniyi.com/private-vs-public-marriage-proposa/)

3. Take some time out to unwind from the weekly&#xA0;[Lagos traffic](https://estheradeniyi.com/lagos-traffic-7-fun-things-to-do-when/)

4. Have a fun day with your family

5. Go do some outdoor bonding with your spouse

6. Organize an office get together

7. Go on a date

8. Organize a church picnic

9. Go on a photo shoot

10. Take some really nice pre wedding pictures

I had a really fun day with the other ladies. I guess it&#x2019;s better to go with people than go solo. We shared a lot of really deep and private stuff. It was an avenue to release. In one of our activities, we had a death walk session. So everyone was paired with someone else. You tell this other person about your life and how old you want to be when you die.

You share with them what you want to do, where you want to be in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and so on. You practically plan the rest of your life from now. This helped me discover that I didn&#x2019;t have more than 10-15 years of my life planned. Talking about my death helped me realize how much of things I deeply wanted.

In conclusion, Lekki leisure lake was a really great place and experience overall. I didn&#x2019;t get to ski or surf or ride any boat but it was really really great with the ladies.
