Opportunities knock, unexpectedly, yes. Opportunities mostly come unannounced. Do you know, however that you can place yourself in the path of opportunities? Yes, you can actually position yourself for opportunities but not just opportunities even, right opportunities.

Oh, yeah, there are needless, time-wasting, wrong and blatantly destructive opportunities. This is where you have to be able to discern which opportunities are worth investing in, which ones don&#x2019;t even need a second of your time.

We learn survival skills very early if we were especially not born into a wealthy environment. Part of these skills include tuning in our ears and sharpening our minds to situations that might be the big bomb, the spark that blossoms into full blown fire.

Having these opportunities for a career bloom or business growth isn&#x2019;t what&#x2019;s the most important actually. What are, &#xA0;like I said earlier :

-recognizing the right opportunities
 -knowing where to find them
 -knowing how to position yourself for the right opportunities

Use your time and space well. Expend energy on what will give you better returns. Be alert and position yourself for the [right opportunities](https://www.tfolc.org/the-right-attitude-the-right-opportunities/).
