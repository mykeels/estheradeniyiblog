While we were just recovering from the musical groovy effect
 &#x2018;[Thank You Lord](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/thank-you-lord-by-pat-uwaje-king-lyrics)&#x2019; stamped on our hearts, Pat Uwaje-King, Midnight Crew&#x2019;s lead singer
 released another new single, &#x2018;Amara&#x2019;. Her new song which means Grace was
 produced by Shabba Producer; it was mixed and mastered by Zeeno Foster.

We can&#x2019;t get enough of Pat Uwaje-King as she serves us
 another doze of musical energy. Speaking about the song, Pat Uwaje-King wrote:

&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a product of GRACE! The Father&#x2019;s amazing GRACE.
 Undeserved Mercy, that&#x2019;s what His Grace represents to me. And so, this song
 comes from a PLACE of sincere gratitude. When I take a mental journey back to
 the past and I behold the present, I&#x2019;m filled with this huge sense of deep
 GRATITUDE, to the ONE who owns the whole Earth and chooses to live inside of me
 and express Himself&#x201D; through me!
