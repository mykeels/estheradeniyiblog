When you step into a [restaurant in Nigeria](http://www.restaurantsng.com/), no matter the star,
 structure, menu or service, the concluding part of your visit should be your
 taste bud&#x2019;s satisfaction, what is left in your purse and if you want to
 recommend them to your friends.

&#xA0;

After research, reviews from customers and visits, there are lots of chefs/cooks
 doing great cooking out there.&#xA0;Here is a list of top 6 restaurants in Nigeria
 according to some visitors and customers that cannot help but loud it.

&#xA0;

- Sky Lolo &#x2013; &#xA0;Ose-Olohun aka Skye Lolo is located
 at Bodija Ibadan beside a popular Skye bank that was made popular by Sky Lolo.
 The most interesting thing about Sky Lolo is that it does not have an online
 platform or a logo that we are aware of but it is the best spot in Ibadan for Amala. If
 you really want to have a taste of what the real amala is like, you should
 check out Sky.

- Jevenik &#x2013; according to a customer, &#x201C;the food is always too
 much. I never finish it. Go there at your stomach&#x2019;s peril.&#x201D;, one would have to
 try doing some once in a life-time things. The best thing to do would be to try
 out Jevenik which has locations in Lagos (Mainland and Island) and Abuja.

- Spur &#x2013; is known for its chicken and chips, according to a
 regular there, &#x201C;their chicken and chips and Jollof rice can make Odysseus kill
 Poseidon with a clenched fist&#x201D;. One would have to try and see to understand the
 description used.

- The Place &#x2013; My personal favorite restaurant. Asun and Dodo is the testimony of most people
 that visit ever friendly restaurant. They pride themselves on quality
 management. The taste on the island is the same as that on the mainland.
 Another favorite is the local/concussion rice. Forget jollof rice and all its
 spices and go in for the local. Worth every kobo. Visit [The Place Restaurants](http://www.theplace.com.ng/)&#xA0;for a location close to you in Lagos.

- Yellow Chilli &#x2013; Located at 35, Joel Ogunaike Street, GRA
 Ikeja delivers on point variety of gourmet meals, spicy local and pan-African
 delicacies. It is known for its notorious Seafood Okoro that can make a grown
 man confess to being his weakness over there.

- Igwe&#x2019;s Palace &#x2013; Located at New Road, Kano Nigeria is a home away from home. They dish quality food that would leave you satisfied and unbothered about time spent to consume it.
