If you can&#x2019;t be at the [free essential oil class in Ilorin next month](https://estheradeniyi.com/attend-a-free-essential-oil-class-in-ilorin-kwara-state-2nd-edition/), you can tap into the one that will be ongoing in Lagos at about the same time, the same day too. It will be hosted by Olubunmi Samuel, an essential oil enthusiast like me. Hear what he has to say:

A lot of people have heard me use essential oils or talk about them, it is kinda surprising that a guy like me will be so much engrossed with the idea of essential oils. Most people&#x2019;s knowledge about Essential Oils is that they are used for beauty and hair care, and because I am not a woman, everyone wonders what I am doing here&#x2026;

I am glad to announce to you that Essential Oils transcends using them for beauty and hair care, there are oils that work for these things, but they are way more than that.

Essential Oils are oils extracted from plants, they are called &#x201C;essential&#x201D; because they contain the essentials of the plant, so using essential oils can get you as much benefit you can get from any plant.

These oils are often used for aromatherapy, a form of alternative medicine in which healing effects are ascribed to aromatic compounds.
