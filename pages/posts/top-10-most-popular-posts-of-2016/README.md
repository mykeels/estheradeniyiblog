 Hello my esteemed blog readers. I decided to do a post on what my 2016 popular posts were. This is a way of doing a review of my blog in 2016. With this review, I also have an idea of what to post more in 2017. Even though some of the posts rose to top &#xA0;because of the aggressive post link sharing and effective SEO strategies (e.g &#x2018;Iyawo mi&#x2019; post), digging them up has given me an overall idea of what my readers (you) want. And of course, I will sometime conduct a poll to know what you&#x2019;d like to see more of on my blog this year.

Here are the posts. You can click to check out anyone you find interesting.
