This blog post is all about **how to pull off the all-natural look** successfully. How do you confidently walk out of that room without makeup without having to refrain or feel less of yourself?[![Alicia Keys on no makeup](images\AliciaKeysnomakeup.jpg)](images\AliciaKeysnomakeup.jpg)

I was inspired by Agbani Darego. I started following her on Instagram two years ago and I must confess that I am surprised that she rarely has drama going on on her face.

I took off to the internet to go search for &#x2018;**how to pull off an all natural look**&#x2018; and the search results were baffling. I tell you. All I could find was mostly &#x2018;how to apply the natural look make-up&#x2019; etc. Does this mean that we are no more comfortable with our natural features anymore?

## My four tips to pulling off a natural look

(emphasis: no make-up) without a feeling of guilt.

### Haveyour eyebrowswell&#xA0;trimmed

This cannot be over-emphasized. Your eyebrows define your face. For girls like me who are hairy, shape it every week. Be careful to check out eyebrow shapes on the internet. The face of your shape is very important when choosing a base pattern. There are a lot of resources on the internet now. It is important that you get someone to do it for you if you are not good at it. Remember that no eye-pencil is concealing any mishaps.

### Massageyourlipsthenightbefore

The lips have a natural tendency to dry up easily. Matte lipsticks are aggressive on your lips. Saliva, dirt, hot liquids and a host of other things we do to our lips affect them. Lip scrubs help to peel off dead skin sitting on your lips. Use it and a lip balm for extra covering before going to bed. Vaseline is also a very good substitute for lip balm. You should wake up the following morning with soft and supple lips. You can also apply a little bit of lip balm after your&#xA0;bath so as to protect your lips.

### Useafacialscrub

Yes, your face. Remember that you are not going to be concealing. Scrubbing your face the night before is also very helpful. Let your facial skin breathe. I recommend [St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub](https://estheradeniyi.com/st-ives-fresh-skin-apricot-scrub/). It has been working well for me. You can optionally go for an even tone moisturizer or foaming cleanser. I use Palmer&#x2019;s Skin Success foaming cleanser. Like I mentioned earlier, this one is optional. Scrubbing is more important.

### Makesureyourhairisneat

Lastly, your hair. Your hair is very important. If it isn&#x2019;t in good shape, you look unkempt. If it&#x2019;s rough, apply a gel. A wide range of gel products is now available in stores. If you are going to fold, pack or tie, make it neat. Just like your eyebrows define your face, your hair does also.

So, there you go: a defined and well-shaped eyebrow, succulent lips, clean face, and neat hair.
