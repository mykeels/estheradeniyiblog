 I bow before your throne

(VERSE 1)
 Onye di nso, (Holy One)
 I lift my hands to you
 Onye di nso,( Holy One)
 cause only you deserve it
 Onye di nso, (Holy One)

 Chionye di nso, (Holy one)
 To you I give my all
 Men may not understand
 How far you brought me
 They may not understand

 Onye di nso, (Holy One)
 The only precious lamb of God
 Onye di nso, (Holy One)
 Obata obiye (When His involved things change)
 I can&#x2019;t imagine what I would be without you, go without you,live without you..
 I can&#x2019;t imagine what I will be without you
 Where I would go without, I can&#x2019;t live without You&#x2026;

 Men may not understand
 How far you&#x2019;ve brought me
 They may not understand
