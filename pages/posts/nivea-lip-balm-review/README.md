## Why do you ever need a lip balm?

Unlike all the other parts of our body, the lips are exposed to so many things other parts of the body are protected from. Talk about saliva, dirt, dusty wind, sun, cold, harmattan, food residiue, saliva from our lovers and even fake lipstick and lip stains. The lips are just as vulnerable to as many things as we can even think of. It&#x2019;s however unfortunate that these same lips are the body organs without protection e.g sebacious glands.

As a result of this, the lips tend to battle with a lot of things. Our lips become rough, dark, chapped, cracked and all of the ugliness that can&#x2019;t be expressed. Have you ever had to particularly look at a baby&#x2019;s lips? They are so pink, smooth and just totally kissable.

This is because they have not spent long enough time to begin to build debris on their lips. They also are able to have natural lip exfoliation quicker as their skins regenerate more quickly than adults.

So, **what do lip balms do**? How do they work to help give the desirable lips we long for? How do they counteract all of the things our lips are exposed to? Lip balms provide the lips with moisture. Moisturizing the lips helps to keep them supple. Lip balms also serve as a layer between the lips and external contaminants like dusty wind and harsh or extreme weather.

Lip balms also help to cause gentle exfoliation. With already damaged and ugly looking lips, a good lip care like Nivea range of lip balms will help them become supple and healthy, especially the corners of the mouth with intense moisturization.

## Is Lip Balm for guys?

Question is, do guys have lips? If guys have lips then they also have to consider using lip balms. You will agree with me that a lot of men are working around with totally unacceptable lips. Dark lips are a total turn off. It&#x2019;s worse if they are chapped and cracked. It&#x2019;s more difficult for a guy to conceal his ugly lips because they do not have the luxury of covering up their lips with colours and pigments like women do.

A conern however for guys is how their lips are going to come off as if they apply lip balms. They wonder if they are also going to appear looking glossy and feminine. I mean no one wants to be questioned about their straightness all because of a lip care routine.

There are a number of lip balms for guys in stores, online and offline. In fact, all you have to do as a guy is to go online to search for a good lip balm specifically made for men. What you have to do as a guy is to look out for three important lip balm components as these are your needs for a good lip care routine.

Sunscreen, preservatives and fragrances are all you need. The purpose of using a lip balm is to protect it and help it regenerate and heal from all of the lip damage that has already been impacted. With a good SPF number, the lips should be adequately protected from the harsh ultraviolet rays.

If you are allergic to fragrances, you should watch out for that also in lip balms. Lip balm fragrances are also capable of triggering allergic reactions on the lips. You don&#x2019;t want swollen, itchy or wounded lips on account of lip balms, trust me.

## How can you make your lips pink

It&#x2019;s definitely the dream of every self conscious person to have supple, soft and pink lips. There are honestly times when you want to go out with your bare lips without having to worry about adding some colour to cover up for the lip lapses. So, **how do you get pink lips**? I will outline a few ways you can achieve pink lips.

**1. Exfoliate**

Exfoliating helps to remove dead skin cells sitting on the lips. With exfoliation, you can peel away dead lip skin that is preventing fresh new skin from forcing their way through and giving their shine. There are a number of ways to exfoliate your lips for pink lips.

You can use your toothbrush to exfoliate your lips for pinker lips. All you have to do is moisturize or dampen your brush with water. In circular motions, rub the toothbrush on your lips. To see quicker and more pronounced results, it is best to do this as consistently as you can. I will also advise that you do not use the regular toothbrush you use to brush your teeth.

You can also prepare homemade lip exfoliants. There are a number of tutorials on the internet on how to make **homemade lip scrubs**. You have to combine some natural products with sugar especially as it helps to create a course texture that cause effective lip scrubbing.

**2. Deeply clean off lipstick**

Remember that earlier in this article, I mentioned that a lot of things cause the darkening of the lips. Lipstick that isn&#x2019;t properly cleaned sits on the lips overnight and stunts the natural exfoliation process that should happen while asleep.

You will be shocked how much of lipstick hides in the cracks and corners of our lips. It is advised that we use good [baby wipes](https://estheradeniyi.com/baby-wipes-7-other-incredible-uses/) to clean off every lipstick residue. This will help to begin to reveal pink lips.

**3. Moisturize**

Moisturizing the lips helps to make your lips softer and supple. This can help give your lips a pink illusion. You can moisturize your lips with a good lip balm like Nivea lip balm. You can also use your normal facial cream for moisturizing your lips as long as they are of a deeply moiturizing formula. Moisturize especially after cleaning or exfoliating.

**4. Stay hydrated**

I know that this sounds like the health cliche kind of talk but I want to assure you of how much of benefits are there in drinking lots of water. In fact, some people claim that the level of the dryness of your lips is an indication of how much of hydrated you are.

**5. Wear lip balm**

So, we have been able to establish the usefulness of lip balms. We know that a good lip balm with SPF will help to protect the lips from further damage. This will help you maintain your pink lips and prevent the occurence of dark lips.

## Can I get lip sunburn?

The lips are as susceptible to sunburn as other parts of the body because they do not even have as much melanin as other parts of the body. It is good to therefore go for lip balms with SPF 15 and above. A lip balm with SPF as high as 30 is better for extreme weather conditions like hot and beach days out.

## Nivea Lip Balm Shades

Thankfully with the full and wide range of all of Nivea lip balms, you have protection of all sorts, fragrances, colours and textures. Nivea Lip Balms are known to be gentle and soothing to the lips. The protection that Nivea Lip balm offers is a lot of advantages it has over other drugstore or popular lip balms we have in stores, super marts and markets.
