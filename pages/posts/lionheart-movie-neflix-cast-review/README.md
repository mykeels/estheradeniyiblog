I enjoyed watching **Lionheart on Netflix** even though it took so long to finally get around to it. The buzz around **Lionheart movie by Genevieve Nnaji** is not one just anyone can ignore, especially if Netflix is suggesting the movie to you.

In 2018, Lionheart was debuted on Netflix and that seemed to be one of the best moves of [Genevieve Nnaji](https://estheradeniyi.com/genevieve-nnaji/) professionally. This did not only hype the movie but heightened the expectations of Nigeria and so many other people who got to watch it.

Netflix is beginning to warm up to Nollywood, which I think is by far, Africa&#x2019;s largest movie industry at the moment.

Reports say that they are putting $8 billion original production budget to work in Nigeria&#x2019;s Nollywood movie industry.- [QZ](https://qz.com/africa/1384217/netflix-buys-nollywood-movie-lionheart-by-genevieve-nnaji/)

Even though I am not exactly sure of the figure but people seem to be all about inquisitive on **how much Netflix paid Genevieve Nnaji to acquire Lionheart**. The most popular version of this cost is 3.8 million dollars which is an approximate whooping 1,368,798,000 in&#xA0; Nigerian Naira

**The cast of Lionheart** is such a beautiful one and I make bold to say that it had in it [many of the favorite Nigerian actors](https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/movies/lion-heart-the-extraordinary-cast-of-genevieve-nnajis-directorial-debut/shzm2ml) people would love to see even if they were not thinking about it.
