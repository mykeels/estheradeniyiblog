On [Debonair](http://debonairafrik.com/exclusive-interview-with-denola-grey/), he was asked what year and when he got his big break. In his own words, &#x201C;I would definitely say 2014, the year I launched my website. I teamed up Toyosi Kekere-Ekun and we shot some pictures for my website (www.denolagrey.com&#xA0;) In June of that year, the launch was very well-received and I started writing for Bella Naija. I got my first TV offer with Ebony Life in November of that year and also went to some events, which gave me some great red carpet moments.&#x201D;

Denola Grey began his fashion career at only 18 and gained immense success. He progressed in his career as a media consultant and has exponentially catapulted his fashion career under the Grey Brand to heights unimaginable. One peculiar thing about him is how very little of his personal life the public knows.
