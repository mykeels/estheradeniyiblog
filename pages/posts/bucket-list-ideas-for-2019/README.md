Just if you are wondering what to put on your bucket list (some of us suck at creativity), I have created a check list that you can pick from.

Even if you don&#x2019;t settle for many or any of them, items on the list may spark up your creativity and ideas may come alive.

I have 50 of them, please add more in the comments section if you have. Hopefully, this adds some colour to 2019!
