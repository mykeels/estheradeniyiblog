It&#x2019;s been a while I did a product review and so while I was having my bath, I remembered that **Vaseline intensive care cocoa radiant lotion review** is what I&#x2019;d be using afterward. Of course, I should write a Vaseline intensive care cocoa radiant lotion review.

To be honest, I didn&#x2019;t expect less of Vaseline cocoa lotion. Anything with cocoa butter is definitely a go for me. It&#x2019;s funny how I didn&#x2019;t plan to buy it but ended up buying it.

I went to my favorite store to get **Nivea cocoa butter** ([check review here](https://estheradeniyi.com/nivea-cocoa-butter-body-lotion-review/)) only to find out that it was finished. I went again at a later date and it was the same story. My sister went to check it out in another store, exhausted too!

Man, people must be seriously on Nivea cocoa butter lotion or it&#x2019;s just suddenly become scarce. I asked her to buy the nearest alternative. Normally, I would have gone for **Nivea natural fairness** ([review here](https://estheradeniyi.com/nivea-natural-fairness-review-2/)) but I decided it would be best to pick something completely different this time.

I just told her to use her discretion and I ended up with Vaseline. The fact that it was cocoa butter made me welcome it with open arms. I trust anything from that plant, lol.

**The smell**

This is obviously what I love the most. I like to use body creams that make me want to devour me. It smells so good. Of course, like the customary cocoa butter smell.

**It is deeply moisturizing**

So when my sandalwood moisturizing cream finished, I was very sad because, to be honest, that has been the only facial moisturizer that has worked well with me so far. So I bought Clean and clear advantage spot control moisturizer.

While it seemed to work well at the moment because it was water based and therefore oil control, the aftermath was that facial skin began to look very dull. I definitely didn&#x2019;t want that.

So I stopped using it and began a search for jojoba oil. Many things are scarce here in Ilorin. I didn&#x2019;t find it. I began to think long and hard so I decided to use Vaseline as a moisturizer for my face.

After all, it claimed to be deeply moisturizing. In just 48 hours, the results were amazing! It very well moisturized my face and my skin looks much brighter and nourished.

**I like the packaging**

The colour and shape of the container are very attractive Maybe the lid is not one I would ordinarily like.

**The after-feel**

It&#x2019;s smooth and soothing on my skin after application

## Vaseline intensive care cocoa radiant lotion reviews

So far so good, it has been an amazing three weeks of Vaseline intensive care cocoa radiant lotion. I had some of my friends submit their reviews too. Read below:

&#x201C;*The weather here in the northeast can be absolutely extreme in terms of the heat. Vaseline Cocoa butter literally acts like a shield against it and keeps my face well moisturized without making me sweat. I sweat a lot but this cream saves me from that. I also love the smell. I can&#x2019;t remember the last time I had to stress about using makeup because I&#x2019;ve gotten so comfortable with Vaseline*.&#x201D; &#x2013; Esinet Okunrotifa

&#x201C;*I&#x2019;m actually not a fan of lotions but the moment I saw Vaseline cocoa butter and I perceived it (I&#x2019;m actually the kind of person that is a nice smell freak), it smelt so nice, I went for it immediately. I was actually going for another body cream. I started using it, going to 2 months now, and my skin has been glowing and shinning since then*.&#x201D; &#x2013; Joy Adeniyi

&#x201C;*I love it. Great feel and smells nice as well. Worked well for my skin colour.*&#x201D; &#x2013; Kuti Adetoye Olusola

&#x201C;*I love the fact that it smells nice&#x2026;*&#x201C;- Osibajo Esther Toluwalope

&#x201C;*Don&#x2019;t really like it, so I switched to Nivea, which is the best for me&#x201D;.* &#x2013; Oluwatosin B Idowu

&#x201C;*Smells nice, I noticed it work best on my black skin at night, but whenever I rub it and go out in the sun.. I become black as charcoal and I get rashes on my face.*&#x201C;- Joseph Ini Bassey

&#x201C;*That is what I currently use. It&#x2019;s not bad actually*&#x201D; &#x2013; hoyinmii

&#x201C;*So I just switched to this when i could not find the initial brand and same cocoa fragrance lotion I used&#x2026;.I just took Vaseline cocoa lotion based on the whole cocoa thing and boom it was legit the best decision I made&#x2026;The cocoa is so concentrated,that I could literarily smell myself all day everyday(not to sound creepy or anything&#x1F602;) The way it just absorbs and moisturises so deep into my skin is heavenly&#x2026;..I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m going back on it.*&#x201D; &#x2013; @temmy_carter

&#x201C;*Prefer to use organic butters and oils like shea butter and coconut oil. Organic is the best*&#x201D; &#x2013; @ goodgalzed

&#x201C;*I do use it during winters.. though nothing equals the organic ones, it is still good in terms of moisturizing property and the smell of cocoa butter*&#x201D; &#x2013; @ sowmya.sundaram

&#x201C;*I have used it and liked it for moisture but the smell is too sweet for me*.&#x201D; &#x2013; @couleursdelavie

&#x201C;*I had my body lotion finished so I decided to use my sister&#x2019;s own. She uses Vaseline intensive care cocoa radiant lotion. It has a very nice smell and good texture. It moisturizes the skin deeply. It made my skin white/dry probably because I have oily skin or I didn&#x2019;t use it lavishly. I recommend Vaseline Cocoa Butter for people with dry skin but it is meant to be used lavishly for effective result*.&#x201D;- Grace Adeniyi

Ever used this before?&#xA0; What do you think of it?
