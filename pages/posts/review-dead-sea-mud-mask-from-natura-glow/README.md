The first time I used a dead sea mud mask was two weeks ago. The first time I ever heard of dead sea mud mask was last year on one of my numerous skin care tours on the Internet.

Apparently, dead sea mud was an item everyone was frantically looking to add to their beauty routine and to be honest, why not? And no, they didn&#x2019;t have to go to Israel to have a portion, best part.

Apart from the drop dead appealing pictures of people in dead sea mud mask, which is ironic as you are supposed to be looking very dead, the mask comes with a lot of skin rewarding benefits. Coolest part is that dead sea mud masks are not only for your facial skin, you can use them on your entire body.

## What is dead sea mud mask?

Dead sea mud mask is a combination of dead sea mud (major constituent) and other ingredients depending on the brand of the dead sea mud mask in question.

The Dead Sea is a body of water found between Israel and Jordan. The Israelites must be this lucky though. It is said that it is the lowermost sea on earth, it is very salty and full of natural resources and mineral salts of all kinds.

The sea-shore has a very rich mud as these naturally occurring minerals containing potassium, sodium and magnesium are washed to the shore. It is from here the mud is gotten.

Because not everyone can visit Israel for the dead sea mud, companies go to this region to extract this mud and then process into different dead sea mud products, including the dead sea mud mask. People are seen along the shores totally covered in dead sea mud from head to toe.

It is such a therapeutic mud because it not only brings the skin to youth, it helps cure a lot of ailments and skin problems on whatever part of the body. Isn&#x2019;t that just cool?

## How to use dead sea mud mask

The first time I used this dead sea mud mask from [Naturaglow by Abby Jo,](https://naturaglowbyabbyjo.com/product/dead-sea-mud-mask-for-face-body/) I applied too much on my face. On subsequent usage, I was nearly accurate on measurement, I think.

So, below are steps on how to use the dead sea mud mask to get the best out of it.

1. Wash your face and pat dry. You want to apply this on a clean skin.

![How to apply dead sea mud mask on your face, pat dry](images\how-to-use-dead-sea-mud-mask-pat-your-face-dry.jpg)Pat dry. Didn&#x2019;t know I would have to say this. Teachers must have a special grace tho&#x2019;.
This will afford this mask the opportunity to reach deep within your skin and throughly cleanse your skin pores.

2. Scoop some mask little by little and apply a thin layer per time on your skin.

Make sure to leave out your eyes and your lip areas. Evenly distribute the mud mask on your face.

It comes with a silicone applicator brush with which you can apply on your face. I prefer to use my clean fingertips.

3. Leave the mask on for 10-15 minutes to dry.

You can go on scrolling Instagram or dancing to the music in your head. If you are boring, simply cross your legs and count 1- 1,000

4. With warm water, gently wash off the mud mask in circular motions and pat your face dry with a washcloth.

5. To achieve best results, it is great to use a moisturizer afterward. I use my [sandalwood moisturizer by Young Living essential oils](https://estheradeniyi.com/sandalwood-moisturizing-cream-by-young-living-essential-oils/).
