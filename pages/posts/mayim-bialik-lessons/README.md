**Mayim Balik**: my most recent muse and woman crush.

Besides her hot legs, Mayim Bialik is an entire inspiration! I am not sure this is at all a cool thing but I have been binging on anything that has Mayim Bialik in it on YouTube. My YouTube history cries out for excessiveness right now. I am inspired and triggered, this is the most positive way to put it.

Recently, I concluded the **final episodes of The Big Bang Theory**. It&#x2019;s funny that my favorite people in the series are married to each other in the series. I most admire Mayim Bialik (**Amy Farrah Fowler**) for her off-screen life and Jim Parsons (**Sheldon Cooper**) for his on-screen life.

I am so blessed to know her and watch her live her life to the fullest. I am both inspired and challenged, I am also encouraged in many different ways. I would like to share three profound things I am learning from this amazing woman just by watching her.

**3 things I am learning from Mayim Bialik**

*1. It&#x2019;s okay to be multi-faceted.*

If she can successfully be a Neuroscientist and an Actress, anyone can be a Lawyer and a Singer. Do you get my point? I think we always assume that narrowing down is the best way to climb up higher and faster. If it worked that way for other people, it might not work for you if you are just so multitalented.

I would say to a lot of people, I cannot survive being just one thing. It is the same thing with my blog. I even tried once, to narrow down to blogging about blogging alone. I was exhausted and unhappy, my audience was exhausted and unhappy. It didn&#x2019;t make any much sense at the end of the day.

From watching Mayim Balik, I am very much convinced that life is not all black and white. There are also gray scales in between and if we choose to be on the opposite ends of spectrums for fear of being wrong or for the unnecessary obsession of acceptance, we might end up leading boring and very unfulfilled lives.

*2. You are beautiful no matter what*

Let me explain this. While I was just fumbling around some searches about Mayik Bialik, I stumbled on something like &#x201C;Mayim Bialik&#x2019;s nose&#x201D; in Google&#x2019;s predictive search. I was not only amazed, but I was also curious. People go all the way to search for Mayim Bialik&#x2019;s nose? Interesting.

Even though she has admitted to being a prominently nosed, awkward looking and geeky person, and that [she has considered surgery many times](https://groknation.com/health/mayim-talks-noses/), I believe that her nose still brings out all of the beauty in her. It makes her so unique and special and Mayim Bialik. She goes on to prove with her lifestyle that beauty does not end on the outside.

I have had to struggle with a few insecurities myself. I am even at this moment [still considering getting braces](https://estheradeniyi.com/no-i-dont-like-my-gap-too/). I have been in the consideration phase for years now because I am afraid that it will change who I am as a person outwardly. Let&#x2019;s talk about this later.

All I am saying is that what you are dealing with on the outside is mostly as a result of beauty standards, those standards that are never constant, that are unfair and damaging. What matters are what you exude from your inside and how you care for the body that you have been given.

*3. Do not be afraid to be honest*

I know right? You are even asking if this is a thing? Oh yes, it is a thing to be afraid to be honest about one&#x2019;s true feelings about a situation or a phase. You see, this type of honesty comes with a sort of vulnerability. It comes with truly finding out how you feel about something and effectively expressing it.

I have come to realize personally, that to be truly honest about things and situations, you would have to find out exactly how you feel about them. It is so difficult to project your thoughts if you do not really understand your disposition towards it.

I guess, we run away from our feelings sometimes, because they are scary and embarrassing. Watching this video of her (Having a roommate taught me self-love) has taught me a lot in just about seven minutes. I should not be afraid to discover what I think about myself in relation to situations and then be honest about them, especially when I am allowed to.

I am blessed to have known Mayim Bialik and I definitely would like to meet her one day. If this never happens in my lifetime, she has been so much of an impact in my journey to maturity and growth and I think this is enough compensation.
