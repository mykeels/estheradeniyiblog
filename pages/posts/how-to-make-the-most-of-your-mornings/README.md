In my article, how [waking up at 5 AM has entirely changed my life for good](https://estheradeniyi.com/waking-up-at-5-am-literally-changed-my-life/), I take some time out to list the benefits of waking up in the morning. As I write, it is just a few minutes to 6 o clock and I feel at my best.

My thoughts and words flow in a very fresh and seamless way as I sit beside my window to enjoy every puff of morning air I take in. This is such a wonderful time to be up.

I want to share three tips on how to utilize, maximize and make the most of your mornings. I hope that by the time you are done reading this, your mornings will not only be your favorite time of day but your most productive.

*1. Have a consistent morning routine*

Many of the successful people that we know, including entrepreneurs, have a consistent morning routine. This helps you to be mentally, physically and emotionally prepared for a specific set of tasks. Unpredictability may not help to accomplish much. When there are however definite processes in place, it is very easy to accomplish a lot because your brain already begins to make space for how to accomplish them.

So maybe your morning routine is going to be simple or more elaborate, create a routine nevertheless. This is mine:

- wake up (obviously)
- observe my quiet time
- write down my to-do list for the day
- check my emails and Google Analytics
- exercise (I just dance for 30 mins-45 mins in my room. I am trying to make this constant)
- freshen up
- blog for the most part

*2. Do the most demanding and difficult tasks first*

What you have to realize about your morning is that it is indeed powerful. It is a fresh start at the day, a reboot. Don&#x2019;t waste it doing tasks that do not make much sense or will not give you an overall fulfillment at the end of the day.

Spend this time to do all of the things that seem to take your mental energy or that will require some physical activity. This is the best time to power up and get things done. This is also the best time to channel your [energy for batching](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-batch-work-save-time-and-increase-your-productivity/).

*3. Delegate*

Don&#x2019;t be a high octane person, assign tasks. If you spend the most part of your mornings delegating, you would have done very well.

It may sound counterproductive to take the time to begin to delegate instead of actually doing but in the end, you are going to find out that this is going to increase your productivity at the end of the day.
