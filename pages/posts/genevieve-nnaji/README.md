She has a Bachelor&#x2019;s degree in creative arts from the University of Lagos. She started acting at a very young age in the year 1987, at the age of 8. We will still go in-depth into this.

## Genevieve Nnaji&#x2019;s Biography and Early Life

![Genevieve Nnaji](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Genevieve-Nnaji.jpeg)

[Genevieve Nnaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genevieve_Nnaji) grew up in Lagos State although she was born in Mbaise in Imo State. She is the fourth child of eight children and her family was not a very rich one.

Her family belongs to that of the middle class. Genevieve&#x2019;s father worked as an engineer while her mother worked as a nursery school teacher. Genevieve Nnaji as we have stated earlier, schooled in Lagos State for both her secondary and tertiary education. It was while she was in the University of Lagos studying Creative Arts that she started auditioning for acting in Nollywood.

While she was still very young at the tender age of 17, Genevieve got pregnant. She told sources that she did not even know that she was pregnant until her mum noticed that her body physiology had changed. She had a baby girl and the baby was named Chimebuka. Chimebuka lived with her grandmother who is Genevieve&#x2019;s mother so that Genevieve could continue to concentrate on her schooling.

She started acting at the tender age of 8 when she appeared in a TV show called &#x201C;Ripples&#x201D; and she also did lots of advertisement acting for different brands starting at a young age. Despite the early pregnancy and the stigma she suffered from it, Genevieve Nnaji still managed to pull through her early years very well and this is very commendable.

## Genevieve Nnaji&#x2019;s Acting Career

![genevieve nnaji](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/genevieve.jpg)

Besides acting in commercials, she started acting fully at the age of 19. She got her first big major acting role in 1998 for the movie titled &#x201C;Most Wanted&#x201D;.

Like we have stated earlier, this was at the age of 19. After that, she also subsequently starred in &#x201C;Sharon Stone&#x201D; a movie released in 2002. This movie was what shot her to prominent glory as she became very popular after acting the movie. Her fame spread through all of Nigeria and indeed Africa.

People all over Africa and even in some European countries came to know her and acknowledge her as a true gift to the Nollywood acting industry. After that, she also acted in other movies like Mark of the Beast, Ijele, Last Party and so on.

![Genevieve Nnaji](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Genevieve-1.jpg)

In 2010, she acted in the movie &#x201C;Ije&#x201D;, meaning The Journey, which is an award winning movie which helped her to gain even more fame. Ije is a movie released in 2010 that Genevieve Nnaji also starred in. This movie was directed by Chinese Anyaene and produced by Paula Moreno and Chineze Anyaene.

Omotola Jalade Ekeinde also stars in this movie. It was released both in the US and in Nigeria and the movie really hit. The plot of the movie is about a lady named Chioma who travels over to the United States to help her sister Anya who has been charged with the murder of three men. Genevieve Nnaji plays Chioma in this movie while Anya is played by Omotola Jalade Ekeinde.

Since then, Genevieve Nnaji has starred in over 80 Nollywood movies and is still counting. She is thought to be one of the best paid actresses in Nollywood and is truly one of the most popular actresses in Africa due to her immense contributions to the growth and popularity of the Nollywood movie industry. She was the first ever actress to be awarded Best Actress at the 2001 City People&#x2019;s Awards, which normally before that time never acknowledged actors and actresses. She is indeed a blessing to Nollywood obviously and a record breaker.

![Genevive-Nnaji](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Genevive-Nnaji-Shadow-and-Act-770x525.jpg)

It is also worth mentioning that she is the first Nigerian Actress to be profiled on the popular American TV show, The Oprah Winfrey TV show. In a particular episode of it in 2009, she was referred to as the Julia Roberts of Africa. This goes very well in history books because prior to that, no Nigerian actor had ever been profiled on the show. This shows that she was indeed a force to reckon with. She has also appeared in various International magazines about great women in the world in which she has been featured.

Genevieve Nnaji is believed to be one of the richest and the most influential actors in Nigeria and she rightly deserves this. Recently in October 2018, Genevieve Nnaji signed a film deal with a United States Agency called United Talent Agency. This agency represents one of the biggest and world&#x2019;s most celebrated people. UTA represents some of Hollywood&#x2019;s biggest stars like Liv Tyler, Angelina Jolie and so on. This is indeed another remarkable feat for Genevieve Nnaji.

## About Lion Heart by Genevieve Nnaji.

Also in 2018, her movie[ Lion Heart broke Nigerian records by being acquired by Netflix](https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/movies/genevieve-nnaji-says-lion-heart-makes-her-happy-for-nollywood-id8848164.html) which is the world&#x2019;s largest online movie streaming service. Very few movies that are not American make it to Netflix since Netflix is an American service. But Lion Heart being a work and product of the Nigerian Nollywood industry made it to Netflix! This is indeed a giant stride for Genevieve.

She shared the good news on her social media platforms encouraging her fans to go watch the new movie. Netflix has a huge audience in the online community of over 117.6 million subscribers of movie contents. The movie was bought by Netflix to stream on the network. Although, Lion Heart is not the first Nigerian movie to be streamed on the American streaming platform. There are other movies streaming on Netflix that are of Nollywood like The Wedding Party, Road To Yesterday (a film which Genevieve Nnaji herself produced), Fifty and so on.

When Netflix wants to own a movie and have exclusive rights to it, a lot of money is paid by Netflix to the movie producers. Since Lion Heart has been acquired and bought by Netflix, it could have been bought for over 3 million dollars to own exclusive rights to the movie! Lion Heart has not only brought more fame to Genevieve Nnaji, but it has also brought her more wealth. Lion Heart has notable Nollywood actors that starred in it such as Pete Edochie, Nkem Owoh, Onyeka Onwenu, Peter Okoye, Dika Ofoma, and so on.

![GENEVIEVE NNAJI](https://estheradeniyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENEVIEVE-NNAJI.jpg)

Genevieve Nnaji said that they had to fund the movie by themselves because sourcing for funds for a movie production in Nigeria was an Herculean task. The movie Lion Heart is currently rated a whooping 9.2 out of 10 Stars on IMDb, a top movie review website.

Lionheart as we stated earlier, is already a Netflix Original. It is the first Netflix Original film from Nigeria although there are several films that are Nigerian on Netflix, Lionheart is an ORIGINAL.

This movie is Genevieve&#x2019;s directorial debut and is also the first film that Peter Okoye of the Psquare band would act in. This movie is one of the Comedy genre and is intended to make the audience laugh. Lionheart tells the story of Adaeze Obiagu (who is played by Genevieve Nnaji), who is the daughter of Ernest Obiagu (played by Pete Edochie) as she battles to save her father&#x2019;s company along with the help of a man called Chief Godswill (played by Nkem Owoh) from its large amount of debt and also to save the company from being lost to Igwe Pascal (played by Kanayo O. Kanayo).
