**Night School** is definitely one of the most hilarious movies I have seen this year. It was such a great way to spend my day off work. This time, I went with a new friend. As usual, I didn&#x2019;t plan beforehand what I was going to see, I just needed to have some cinema fun.

He had suggested *Night School* but I wanted *Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween.* I had seen some of Night&#xA0;School&#x2019;s buzz all over the internet but I couldn&#x2019;t exactly remember too much about it.

My friend mentioned that it is a comedy movie and guys, I don&#x2019;t leave my house to go and watch comedy movies in the cinema. It just doesn&#x2019;t seem right. What if it&#x2019;s awful? What if all of their attempts&#xA0;to make me laugh doesn&#x2019;t work? What if it is just a stupid comedy like so many of the comedy movies that we have?

And then he mentioned that Kevin Hart was in Night School. Like, Kevin Kevin?

If you have been following my blog. you&#x2019;ll remember how much I gushed about his book, &#x201C;[I Can&#x2019;t Make This Up: Life Lessons by Kevin Hart](https://estheradeniyi.com/i-cant-make-this-up-life-lessons-by/)&#x201C;. That book, to me, is a very sincere and honest life sharing.

[I gleaned so many lessons from Kevin Hart&#x2019;s I Can&#x2019;t Make This Up](https://estheradeniyi.com/i-cant-make-this-up-life-lessons-by/). I immediately told my friend I was definitely, totally watching Night School!

I tried to search my head for the movie trailer of Night School and only just a few scenes flashed. Below is the trailer, you are going to start falling off your chair from here.

## Night School Synopsis

![Night School by Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish](images\Night-School-by-Kevin-Hart-and-Tiffany-Haddish.jpg)

Teddy Walker (real-life Kevin Harts) is a kid who always fails woefully at school, he isn&#x2019;t bright at all. He drops out and swears that his lack of proper education isn&#x2019;t going to affect him and in reality, it doesn&#x2019;t as he becomes that salesman who would sell air to just about anybody.

He accidentally blows up his place of employment as is compelled to take GED tests to qualify for another profitable job. He has to attend night school to make it work. All of his journey to successfully have a GED turns his life around in a way he never expects.
