So, **Lagos traffic**, the sickening thing many [Lagos residents](https://estheradeniyi.com/lagos-danfo-buses/) have to go through every day. To even think that there is a **Lagos traffic app** makes the whole of this the more hilarious. They say it is to show **current Lagos traffic** and I think that makes sense anyway.

It is in Lagos that you leave your house only to get to your destination two hours later than you ever imagined. Lagos traffic can daze you. Lagos traffic will convince you that man proposes by God disposes. Ever spent six hours on the road dragging your car like a heavy machine? It is in Lagos traffic!

## A typical afternoon along Falomo bridge in Ikoyi, Lagos

Okay, I know this is not a joke. People swear by how bad this is. Lagos traffic can ruin your day abeg. Imagine having to be stuck for hours unending. The annoying thing about traffic in Lagos is the unpredictability. You just get on the road and you are stuck. Gosh!

The **Apapa traffic gridlock** was particularly a menace. I don&#x2019;t know the update now, I hope it&#x2019;s better. Let&#x2019;s not even talk about traffic on Lagos Ibadan expressway or traffic report on Ikorodu road. The Lekki traffic update is a great way to stay on top and not get stuck.

This city is densely populated and the roads are bad but sometimes you just can&#x2019;t point out the causes of Lagos traffic. Everything is just meddled up and all in a second, there is nowhere to drive through. Have you heard about the [**new Lagos traffic law**](http://thenationonlineng.net/thenewroadtrafficlaw.pdf)? You should check that up. I think this is a step forward for drivers who are impatient, reckless and just generally sick.

On my way from Obalende yesterday (news flash: I rarely go out. I am working on this boring part of my blogger life), I got stuck in traffic. This was 7 pm ish. Well, how else did I ever get this blog post idea?

I had a lot of time to think and just be; one ridiculous benefit of Lagos traffic.

You guys, see how you got me stuck in eko. Uhn? A long term friend of mine chatted me up yesterday and said, &#x2018;so you are now a proper Lagosian, uhn&#x2019;&#x2026;. I am like, &#x2018;errrrrr&#x2026;&#x2019;

Okay, so I know that there is nothing fun about Lagos traffic but we just have to keep on moving you know. Let&#x2019;s see what fun stuff you can do.

## Reach out to family and friends

![Reach out to family and friends in Lagos traffic](images\Reach-out-to-family-and-friends-in-Lagos-traffic.jpg)

The hustle and bustle of Lagos is mad. Very very mad. If you don&#x2019;t watch it, you are going to lose touch with your folks. It&#x2019;s such a crazy routine. Wake up, go to work, come back from work, traffic in between, sleep.

Take this time to chat up your brother, call your long-term friend. Wish a friend a happy birthday, tell someone special you love them. Connect okay, just connect.

## File your nails

Ahahahahahahah&#x2026; Lol. I bet, you rarely have the time to look after your own personal grooming. Or maybe you do. Whatever. Just clean your nails. Traffic in Lagos is finally bad turn good after all.

## Listen to music

![listen to music in traffic](images\listen-to-music-in-traffic.jpeg)

You can create a traffic play list. Ah, yes o. You cannot come and die o. Just go add some feel good songs to a Play list and be on a musical roll.

Nod your head, dance if you want to. This is Lagos. I have been here long enough to know that while you think people cared, they were thinking of dinner and their beds and their babies.

## If it&#x2019;s traffic on 3rd mainland bridge, just enjoy nature

![third mainland bridge](images\third-mainland-bridge.jpeg)

Remind yourself to stop for a while. Just stop and be calm. In between boarding and alighting, you can just be still and do nothing. If you are in there, don&#x2019;t think about the current traffic in third mainland bridge, just enjoy the cool breeze on the bridge.

## Listen to Lagos radio, finally

![lagos traffic radio](images\lagos-traffic-radio.jpeg)

Well, this is if you are in your car. Thing is this, if you are always stuck in Lagos traffic around the same time of the day, just create a routine around it. You can just get stuck with a program that keeps you sane.

You are probably never going to listen to radio ever again during the day so make the most of traffic time.

## Rant about Lagos traffic on social media

Oh well, you are going to have Lagos traffic mates on social media. This is especially if you are talking about this during Lagos rush hours.

So, tweet about it, go scream on Facebook. Take a traffic picture for your Instagram followers. Create an interesting conversation online if you are up to it. If you want this more personal, just go update your whatsapp status and get your whatsapp buzzing. Hehehe..You can also check Lagos traffic twitter for updates on traffic in Lagos to know where to avoid.

## Watch a movie

So I used to reserve some movies for traffic. I remember watching some of my favorite movies in traffic. I watched them bit by bit. It was more exciting for me that way. Some people don&#x2019;t like that idea anyway.

Just get cool movies and immerse yourself. If you ever miss your bus stop, that&#x2019;s on you. Sorry.

What fun things do you do in Lagos traffic?
