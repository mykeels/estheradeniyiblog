The recent Google Updates have rendered a lot of webmasters hopeless and discouraged. [The Google September updates](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-algorithm-update-26437.html) influenced and drove an impact that was a hit back to back on sites that heavily depended on search engine optimization as a major strategy of traffic generation.

Bloggers who have worked so hard to be on Google&#x2019;s side have hit rock bottom and are currently tilting towards desperation. It&#x2019;s worse for Bloggers who are already earning from their blogs because obviously, revenue is negatively impacted.

The worst of the hopeless set of webmasters are those who own e-commerce websites and have been hit. Being hit is not even enough to fret about as matters can quickly be handled and in no time actions to bounce back can be taken.

What&#x2019;s sad about the entirety of this is that Google isn&#x2019;t saying specifically what many of these updates are all about. If we had an idea of what the updates are about, there is a clear-cut direction on what next to do to recover and also avoid being hit by subsequent similar updates in the future.

As regards one of the updates, popularly known as the medic update, Google had said that sites that were hit were probably not going to recover from it and all they needed to do was just continue to publish quality content and improve on their websites overall. Of course, that was a dead-end comment.

[The chatter on the internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/bigseo/comments/9jovnz/google_algorithm_update_27th_september_2018/), in different [search engine optimization](https://estheradeniyi.com/best-seo-tips-for-bloggers/) forums, increased since the most recent &#x2018;Google Birthday Update&#x2019; and it all looks like the rollercoaster is not about to end soon. Traffic has fluctuated for a lot of websites since August and it&#x2019;s gotten worse since the update at the end of September.

If you are totally lost on all of what I am trying to say (which will be somewhat strange), watch this video, it&#x2019;s a good summary/report

For some other sites, they have recovered from the August Google Updates. The Google September update normalized their rankings and got them to normal and maybe better than normal. I am going to however be tilting towards the guys whose sites were negatively impacted.

I have expressed my personal opinions on a lot of the updates, (the effect on websites /blogs and what we can do) in scattered bits on different forums and comment boxes all over the internet. I am also seeking answers like the pack of everyone.

I, however, think that writing an article to smoothly express my thoughts, suggest actionable plans and generally put all of what I think into focus would help me effectively convey all I have to say about this to you. It&#x2019;s been a tough ride so far.

I also hope that the bulk of what I am about to say and suggest will serve as solutions to future Google updates that may cause fluctuations or negative impacts on organic traffic.

**Wait and be patient**

Asking anyone to wait this period out is obviously one of the most difficult things to say right now but this appears to be the most immediate action to take in this case, only that it&#x2019;s a passive one.

On many occasions, a large chunk of SEOs has rushed to take actions and begin to edit sites based on a certain perception or conviction about what Google is actually doing.

It turns out in the end that the update seems to be reversed and many people are left exasperated as to how to handle the reversal and get their websites back on Google&#x2019;s side.

One of such updates was that which had to do with meta description characters. There was a very confusing fluctuation in between SERPS view on desktop and mobile. The general notion about that was that there had been an increase in allowable character count for meta description.

It turned out after a while that there was a decrease and then an immediate increase. We all took the cue and left our sites and that of our clients&#x2019; the way they were.

Swift actions after a fresh Google update are usually the worst of its kind. In some cases, swift actions tend to benefit on a short or long term but an assurance of the effect is never guaranteed

**Don&#x2019;t solely rely on only SEO**

Putting all of your eggs in the SEO basket could result in regrets. The best ever strategy for site traffic and lead generation is to explore as many as possible sources of traffic.

As we clearly see, Google is going to keep on updating their AI to be sure that relevant results are displayed to the users. You might not, as a result, be able to pinpoint predict what the update is about and what you can do to make your site comply.

Read what **John Mueller of Google** says:

> Things change, that&#x2019;s kinda normal on an ecosystem as dynamic as the web. There&#x2019;s no meta-tag or HTML tag that will prevent change, and change isn&#x2019;t a sign that your site is bad. One idea might be to work on limiting your dependencies on a single source of traffic, work on turning first-time users into repeat-users, so that as you grow traffic through one source, you also grow the regularly revisiting traffic &#x2013; which is more independent of the initial traffic source.

Explore social media traffic, email list building, guest posting and commenting on sites that are in similar niches as yours. Talk about your site more often offline and be proactive about getting people to like your site and what you as a person has to offer.

**Work on turning first-time visitors into repeat users**

As promised, I mentioned that I was going to share with you, a tool I use to turn first-time visitors into repeat visitors. [Subscribers](https://subscribers.com/). It is free. Register and get the tracking code on your site and begin to have new users visit.

In less than 15 minutes, you are done setting Subscribers up. Another alternative to Subscribers is [One Signal](https://onesignal.com/).

For all of the people, you get Google to bring you, you can turn a fraction of them into repeat users so that you do not entirely &#x2018;waste&#x2019; that traffic.

Another way to turn first-time users into repeat users is to begin to build your email list. This can be tricky for sites that are multi-niched.

An example is my own blog. Even though I talk about Blogging a lot, I like to share a lot of other things like reviews, music, movies etc.

What you can do in this case is to segment your email list. Share each segmented list on different articles. For example, only put the link to a segmented &#x2018;Product review&#x2019; email list you are building on a post in the review category.

Chances are that the first time visitor who has taken enough time to read through and make the decision to subscribe is interested in something very similar.

**Continue to work on your site&#x2019;s overall health**

Google update or not, the plan is to get your site as irresistible as possible to any search engine for that matter. It is also important to improve on the user experience of your site. When users come on, how satisfied are they with your content and the site as a whole.

Consider site speed, check and correct website errors and get your content to satisfy your reader on all levels.

In conclusion, wait this period out, be sure [you are doing your SEO right](https://estheradeniyi.com/seo-is-killing-your-blog/) and begin to brainstorm ways to increase your sources of site traffic.
