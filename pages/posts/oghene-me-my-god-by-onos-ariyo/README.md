Oghene Me was first released in 2015. I was apparently on the moon then. I missed it! The official video was released about 2 days ago and that was when I got to learn about the song.

Now, it hasn&#x2019;t earned a space in my most played play list yet but that is what&#x2019;s currently on repeat. I want to shamelessly admit that the song is not one of my favorites, the visuals are. I like the video. I like the ankara she was putting on and the hair she was wearing. She somehow was striking a resemblance with [Omawumi](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/butterflies-by-omawumi-lyrics-mp3).

O petty me. I really want to talk about how anointed the song is or how blessed I am but really, what&#x2019;s attracted me to Oghene Me is the recently released official video. You can [download the video here](https://en.savefrom.net/#url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=o9uFzdP-Gag&amp;app=desktop&amp;utm_source=youtube.com&amp;utm_medium=short_domains&amp;utm_campaign=ssyoutube.com). I would also like to know from what movie or movies the excerpts were from. If you do know, would you kindly let me know in the comments section?

Mountain high, valley low
 I have never seen the righteous forsaken
 Through the night
 Through the storm
 I&#x2019;ll lift my voice and call you God

 Oghene me
 Oghene me
 I worship you

Oghene me
 Oghene me
 Oghene me

Seasons come and seasons go
 I&#x2019;ll still lift my hands and call You God
 Through the test and through the trials
 I&#x2019;ll lift my hands and call you my God

Oghene me
 Oghene me
 Oghene me
