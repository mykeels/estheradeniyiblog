TY Bello has dropped a very inspiring spontaneous worship video with George and Folabi Nuel. The first time I got to see TY Bello was at [Becoming 2017](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/becoming-conference-2017-event-review)and I was inspired by every word, every sentence she dropped. She is such an anointed woman of God.

I am watching and listening to the music as we speak, as I type and I am blessed just as I work on my blog. I want to have the veil taken away from my eyes. I pray that I am renewed in the spirit and open enough to love the way He loves. I want to become more and more like him every day.

link to New Thursday session with @biggorgy and @folabi_nuel in my profile.
 Now this was a special one . Folabi had written the first verse to a spontaneous song , [THE VEIL](https://www.bellanaija.com/2017/08/the-veil-ty-bello-spontaneous-music/) that came when we sang together at @guidinglightgla . I wrote the second verse and it was a beautiful experience for me . I hadn&#x2019;t written a structured song in so long . We meditated on 2nd Corinthians 3:18 and pulled words from it .. it was efforts . We then called ..at very short notice ..on @showgearonline to help record and film the live rendition of the song ..we had no idea what we were in for .. we sang what we had written for &#x2018;THE VEIL: when I see you&#x2019; and we couldn&#x2019;t stop singing .New explosive music just kept coming out of our mouths and through The piano .. song after song.. after song .. we just gave in to the sound .. we had no choice ..and just let it flow . It was so perfect.. like it was scripted by God Himself .. We couldn&#x2019;t even say the Grace without it turning into another song ..thank you @biggorgy and @folabi_nuel for being a portal for making open .. pure and absolutely sincere God filled Music.I can&#x2019;t thank @showgearonline And their entire team for this beautiful experience. I kept having to pinch my self so see if you guys were real.This is absolutely the beginning of a beautiful journey .
