**Love is War** is stellar! I give it a 10/10. What more does anyone have to say to prove that this is so far the best Nollywood movie in the cinema right now? I write this review still in my clothes, I am just back from the cinema. The best way to preserve that experience is to write about it as *e dey hot*.

## Love is War Movie Trailer

&#xA0;

## Love is War Synopsis

A woman is chosen to become Governor of Osun State but her real state of origin stands to be the first hindrance. Amidst several concerns, her loving husband turns out to be running for the same political post. A marriage that is full of love and beauty quickly turns sour as the two dip their legs into the dirty game of politics.

## Acting

The casting of Love is War was very realistic, they did a very good job at portraying their characters in such a mind-blowing manner

**Omoni Oboli** is a very good actress. What?! She brought her A-game and gave so much life to Mrs. Philips. **Mofe Damijo** was as smooth as he always is. His energy matched with hers in that movie and together they created a balance that was very fun to watch.

Oh my, there were some very steamy scenes in this movie. Gosh! I say it spiced up the whole show and created a very realistic view of the kind of relationship this couple had.&#xA0;

**Toke Makinwa**! Who would have thought? It was not long ago I read someone mention that she should be in a movie. When I saw the movie cast, it was like something I had been waiting for all of a sudden. She was very good at her TV host character.

Every single person who was on screen was perfect. It was natural and very believable. This is one movie that made me sit up with pride. As I watched Nigerian actors perform, I was full of excitement.&#xA0;

## Costume

You can&#x2019;t say many things about a movie&#x2019;s costume until you see what was done on someone nobody should be paying attention to. There was a scene with a gathering of teachers and when I saw the costume, I knew right there and then, the costume director knows exactly what they are doing.

I was particularly drawn towards Omoni Oboli&#x2019;s outfits. Coupled with the fact that they were very complimentary to her role in Love is War is the fact that the styles should be compiled into a fashion lookbook. Maybe if I was more present, I would have thrown away cinema decency and taken pictures of her outfits.

Can we also take a moment to honour her natural hair? The styling of Omoni Obolis natural hair in Love is War was brilliant and befitting. It is not enough to have lush natural hair, it is important to know what to do with it too.&#xA0;

## Music

Right on time, perfect for every mood. They chose the perfect songs, themes, and tracks. I must say that the sound effects and music in Love is War played a very key role in enhancing the already sweet movie.&#xA0;

## Dialogues

This is one element of Love is War that would be unforgivable to omit. The dialogues were interesting and appropriate at every level. There was nothing forced or boring or slow. The language was so rich in this movie that you would stop to check if you are still on Nollywood.&#xA0;

## In Conclusion

**Directed by Omoni Oboli** and **produced by Inkblot**, Love is War is your next movie. You are going to enjoy spending ticket money on this movie. This Nollywood production goes to prove that we can enjoy the utmost best of Nollywood talents, ignite creativity and tell stories that are captivating to just about anyone!
