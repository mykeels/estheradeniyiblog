 Hian! 5000th wonder of the world is right here in &#xA0;my house and that is being torn in two factions of what to eat. Plus, we don&#x2019;t split pots too.

One party says he doesn&#x2019;t eat yam (I don&#x2019;t know when that one started?) the other says he doesn&#x2019;t eat yam porridge abi pottage(whatever that means, I don&#x2019;t know too)

This is called a situation of &#x201C;yam pepper scatter scatter&#x201D; (isu ata y&#xE1;nyan?)
 And like a storm, it hit me, and I prepared this:

Ingredient:
 Yam
 Ugwu
 Onions
 Tomato and rodo
 Olive oil (or any oil of choice)
 Seasoning
 Smoked fish (ponmo or beef or egg)

Unto the cooking things:
Yam

- Slice and peel yam, then chop it into cubes. (I said I don&#x2019;t eat yam porridge.)
- Rinse well and add moderate water that will cook till it softens. (It&#x2019;s better the water is not enough as you can add more to it. This is so because there will be no draining of water from the yam)
- Chop onions and add to the yam.
- Introduce just one seasoning cube (knorr, suppy, royco,maggi,carry&#x2026;) to augment the salt. Allow to cook for 10minutes
- Add sliced ugwu leaves.
- Leave to cook till yam is soft. This is when you should stir(I hope you&#x2019;ve not been stirring o?)
- Reduce heat and allow to steam for 3 minutes, (not yam, not porridge is ready)

Stew

- Grate, blend or slice your pepper, tomato and onions. (Anyway you love it is welcomed)
- Heat your preferred oil
- Your deboned and washed fish (chicken, ponmo, beef of what you want except egg) should go into the hot oil.
- Add your seasoning to the frying fish
- Fry to your level of satisfaction and add pepper in the first step to the mix
- Allow to cook on medium heat for 10-12minutes. Stir at interval to avoid burning (whether nonstick or not)
- Add ugwu leaves (or not)
- Allow to cook on low heat for another 5 -7minutes.

 So I served the one that doesn&#x2019;t eat yam first.&#xA0;

 He: I said I don&#x2019;t eat yam.

 Me: This is white porridge.

 The other one

 He: I said I don&#x2019;t eat porridge

 Me: This is yam with only ugwu. Which kain porridge.

 My brethren, that was how I overcame.
