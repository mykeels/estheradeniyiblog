Every time we ask the Lord for something new, we ask like that is going to be the best thing to happen to us. We ask as if only that will bring us all the joy and fulfillment in life.

We are naturally insatiable, it&#x2019;s not news. We want this, that, everything and more than all of that. We pass through one stage successfully and all of a sudden begin to think the Lord has not done enough. So, we are back to grumbling, complaining, whining and just generally grumpy.

Pause. Rewind.

Remember this one time you asked the Lord for something you wanted so bad. He has done it, hasn&#x2019;t he? All so quickly, you are done basking in the love you felt for having that ultimate gift. Now, you want another one and it&#x2019;s a do or die.

Stay with me, I am trying to bring us both somewhere. You see, where you are right now, you prayed for it years ago. You wanted a new job, you wanted to get married, you needed money to pay rent, you wanted to have children. He answered whatever thing you wanted. Now, you are done with asking to get married, what you want is a child. He answered the first, trust him to answer the second and the next one after that.

Trust God to be able to handle all of your life&#x2019;s pressing needs. [If he did it before, he can do it again](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tyetribbett/ifhediditbeforesamegod.html).

Ask the Lord for whatever you want in faith. Ask him in confidence, approach him with boldness. If he could save you from the hands of a rapist, he will get you out of the hands of that emotional manipulator.

There are some times you really need to wait. We are in different times and seasons so learn to understand that you are in a particular season for a purpose. It might be learn. You might be groomed for growth. You might be toughened up for responsibilities you will have to handle in future. Be patient, wait and key into your timing.

Find the lyrics to a song I think that you need right now. This is a song by Castin Crowns and it&#x2019;s titled, &#x2018;[I&#x2019;ll Praise You In The Storm](https://www.amazon.com/Praise-You-In-This-Storm/dp/B00137KH9S)&#x2018;.

&#x201C;I was sure by now
 God You would have reached down
 And wiped our tears away
 Stepped in and saved the day
 But once again, I say &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;, and it&#x2019;s still raining

As the thunder rolls
 I barely hear Your whisper through the rain
 &#x201C;I&#x2019;m with you&#x201D;
 And as Your mercy falls
 I raise my hands and praise the God who gives
 And takes away

[Chorus:]
 And I&#x2019;ll praise You in this storm
 And I will lift my hands
 For You are who You are
 No matter where I am
 And every tear I&#x2019;ve cried
 You hold in Your hand
 You never left my side
 And though my heart is torn
 I will praise You in this storm

I remember when
 I stumbled in the wind
 You heard my cry to you
 And you raised me up again
 My strength is almost gone
 How can I carry on
 If I can&#x2019;t find You

But as the thunder rolls
 I barely hear You whisper through the rain
 &#x201C;I&#x2019;m with you&#x201D;
 And as Your mercy falls
 I raise my hands and praise the God who gives
 And takes away

[Chorus]

I lift my eyes unto the hills
 Where does my help come from?
 My help comes from the Lord
 The Maker of Heaven and Earth&#x201D;

Please let me know if this blessed you. Share with me in the comments section.
