## Strong Tower Lyrics by Nathaniel Bassey

**&#x201C;Strong Tower&#x201D; (feat. Glenn Gwazai)**

Your name is a strong tower Jesus
 To you belong all power Jesus
 Whenever I call your name
 You always come and make a way
 Your name is a strong tower Jesus

When we call on the name of Jesus
 You will come and make a way
 When we call on the name of Jesus
 You will come and make a way

Your name is a waymaker Jesus
 To you belong all power Jesus
 Whenever I call your name
 You make a way
 Your name is a waymaker Jesus

Your name is a waymaker Jesus
 To you belong all power Jesus
 Whenever I call your name
 You make a way
 Your name is a waymaker Jesus

Jesus! In the midnight hour
 Jesus! In the raging storm
 Jesus! through the troubled waters
 Jesus! I know who to call
 Whenever I call your name you make a way
 Your name is a waymaker Jesus

Call the name now
 Jesus! You&#x2019;re my shield and buckler
 Jesus! That is who you are
 Jesus! You&#x2019;re my horn of power
 Jesus! You&#x2019;re the great I am

Call your name
 When I call your name
 You make a way
 Your name is a waymaker Jesus
 Your name is a strong tower Jesus
 To you belong all power Jesus
 Whenever I call your name
 You make a way
 Your name is a strong tower Jesus

Your name is a strong tower Jesus
 To you belong all power Jesus
 Whenever I call your name, you make a way
 Your name is a strong tower Jesus

Jesus! Your name is a bulldozer
 Jesus! to you belong all power
 Whenever I call your name
 You make a way
 Your name is a strong tower Jesus

Jesus! Your name is a game changer
 Jesus! and to you belong all power
 Whenever I call your name
 You make a way
 Your name is a strong tower Jesus
