2018 is officially ending in hours! You can [check my review here](https://estheradeniyi.com/2018-in-review-esther-adeniyi/)

If I had a chance to delay this, I would. It&#x2019;s the best year that has ever happened to me. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that there were tough times, there definitely were.

It&#x2019;s just that I choose to see the positives because they are a lot to be grateful about.

If I would describe 2018 in one word, I would say &#x201C;Growth!&#x201D;

How would you describe 2018?
