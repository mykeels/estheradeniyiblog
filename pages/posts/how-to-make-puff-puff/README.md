Thing is, Nigerians, we know how to spice up the most ordinary of meals. Of all the snacks that we have in Nigeria, puff puff seems to be the most popular. The closest to this is Nigerian buns.

Haven&#x2019;t you wondered why there are usually so many puff puff balls in a pack of small chops? I don&#x2019;t know if I like the puff puff we find in that selection anyway. It is usually too sugary.

## How to make puff puff

2. Next, you add water to this mixture but gradually. Make sure you are mixing this with your hand. Mix until the consistency is fine.

3. Add your yeast to the mixture. This will make your puff puff paste rise If you however want it to rise faster, you can use warm water the whole time.

I hear that some people make puff puff without yeast, I have no idea how that works. If you do, please share with me in the comments section below.

4. Continue mixing this until you have something that is smooth.&#xA0; The consistency should be in the middle of hard and soft. Just make sure it gradually flows off your spoon.

5. &#x200E;Now, it&#x2019;s time to cover the bowl with aluminum foil.

6. Let the batter in the bowl rise. It&#x2019;s always better to start preparing your puff puff early so that you give it some time to rise.&#xA0; About 40-50 minutes is safe.

7. Heat up your oil. It&#x2019;s better to use a deep pot than a flat frying pan. This will help the puff puff to be immersed into the oil and allow for proper frying.

8. When the oil is hot, scoop some batter into the oil using your inner palm. Press the batter out of your palm until a sizeable amount comes out.

9. Do this for all of the puff puff balls that can be in the pot. When the underside of your Nigerian puff puff is brown, turn it over so that the other side can fry.
