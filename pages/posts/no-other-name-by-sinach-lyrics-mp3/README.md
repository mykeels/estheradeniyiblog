## No Other Name by Sinach Lyrics

No other name above the name

Of Jesus

Yesterday today forever

Jesus

There&#x2019;s no other name like yours

In heaven, earth, beneath the earth

Every knee should bow to the

Name of Jesus

Jesus

No Other name heals all pain

Jesus

No Other name gives peace of mind

Jesus

No Other name breaks stronghold

Jesus

No Other name revives my heart

Jesus

No Other name that give me joy

Jesus

There&#x2019;s no other name like yours

In heaven, earth beneath the earth

Every knee should bow to the

Name of Jesus

Jesus

There&#x2019;s no other name like yours

In heaven, earth, beneath the earth

Every knee should bow to the

Name of Jesus

Name of Jesus

We worship you

Yeaaaaaaaah

Precious Jesus

You are the Great I Am

Precious Jesus

You are the morning star

Precious Jesus

You are the Prince of Peace

Yeah

Precious Jesus

You are my everything

No other name like yours

In heaven, on earth, beneath the earth

Every knee should bow to the

Name of Jesus

Oh Jesus

No other name

No other name like yours

In heaven, earth, beneath what we can see

Jesus

Jesus

Jesus

Jesus
