The most common advice I give to people just starting out a blogging career is to stand on the shoulders of people who have been there. I started blogging when very few people understood what it meant. I therefore had very little practical experience.

Of course, I read e-books and many articles online but really, there&#x2019;s nothing like learning firsthand or learning from someone who has learned firsthand.

I want to quickly share with you 3 mistakes to avoid when you are just starting to blog.

1. Not making enough blogging friends

Here is one mistake I made in my first few years of blogging and it affected me big time. I was such a loner here. I did things all alone, learned all alone, made mistakes all alone. I rarely had anyone to reach out to.

One consolation I have is that there were not many serious bloggers. If I had however consciously reached out to see the few people available, I should have climbed up faster.

So, connect with other bloggers, especially those in your niche. Here is an article on [how to connect with bloggers](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-to-connect-with-other-bloggers). It should help you. Join blogging groups on Facebook, whatsapp or Google+. Be active in the blogging community.

2. &#x200E; Not optimizing your blog for search engine visibility

I started to learn the nitty gritty of SEO way too late. What a dumb mistake to make as a blogger. It&#x2019;s okay if I didn&#x2019;t intend to make much of my blogging career. But for such a serious venture as blogging is to me, it was a stupid mistake to rely only on social media and direct traffic.

Begin to make your posts search engine optimized. Optimize your images. Begin building links. Have an accurate meta description. Learn about keyword, keyword density and most important semantics.

3. &#x200E; Focusing too much on your blog

I am not surprised that you are surprised to hear this. Focusing too much on your blog will get you isolated. I know how it can be difficult to curate blog content. Sourcing, taking or editing pictures for your blog can be time draining too.

Here is what I&#x2019;ll advise. Plan your blogging time. Be intentional about how much time you want to spend on your blog. Begin to visit other blogs too. In fact, guest post. Pass meaningful comments on people&#x2019;s blogs. Do not go around doing &#x2018;nice&#x2019;, &#x2018;k&#x2019;, &#x2018;great post&#x2019; on people&#x2019;s blogs. It&#x2019;s a slap on the totality of your brand.

What mistakes have you made in your early years of blogging? What would you wish to change if you had to go back in time to the beginning of your blogging career? Please share in the comments section.
