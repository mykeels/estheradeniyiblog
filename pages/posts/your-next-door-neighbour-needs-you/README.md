&#xA0;

Kindness is a state of being kind. And being kind means to be affectionate, showing benevolence, being gentle or forgiving. The world is where it is today because of the generosity of some people.

&#xA0;Kindness is one of the fruits of the spirit recorded in Gal 5:22. If you are a Christian, and you are not kind, then you must check yourself if you truly have the Holy Spirit in you.

As I wrote earlier, &#x201C;The world is where it is today because of the generosity of some people.&#x201D; Kindness is in close relation to giving. If God had not given His only begotten son (Jhn3:16) for the atonement of our sins, the chaos in the world would be more than the current situation. Perversion, avarice, inane attitudes, viciousness etc. would have been the order of the day. Thank God for showing us kindness.

You cannot show kindness without love. Little wonder in Gal 5:22, love precedes all other fruits of the Spirit. Kindness is an offshoot of love. Being generous (kind) to others goes a long way in making the world a better place to live.

God does not ally with a person that is not generous. &#x201C;It is a sin to despise one&#x2019;s neighbor, but blessed is the one who is kind to the needy.&#x201D; -Prov 14:21. And one thing is certain: God protects those that give to the needy.

&#x201C;Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble&#x201D;-Psalm 41:1.

Abraham showed kindness to the three Angels of the Lord and he was blessed with a Son (Gen18). Note this: They were total strangers to him and he was not expecting anything in return from them yet he called them into his tent and killed a fat calf for them to eat. What I am emphasizing on is this: do not show kindness only to those you know (Matt 5:46). Be kind to strangers. Who are the strangers?

They are the Beggars by the road side, the poor kid in your neighbourhood that wears just a particular cloth for weeks, the person who meets you at the bus stop asking for help.

Even though in the world today, it&#x2019;s hard to help a total stranger due to their acts of racketeering but that does not stop you from showing kindness. The wisdom of God is in you. Use it applicably.

&#x201C;Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.&#x201D; &#x2013; Lao Tzu.

&#x201C;Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.&#x201D; &#x2013; Plato.

Always remember that &#x201C;your kindness to somebody might wipe away an ocean of tears&#x201D;.
