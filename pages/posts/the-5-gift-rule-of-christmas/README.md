Christmas is around the corner once again and it&#x2019;s time to fulfil the promises you&#x2019;ve made to your kids in the beginning of the year. One of the toughest struggles as a parent is giving your child a joy-filled Christmas, Getting that perfect gift can be a struggle with the rock bottoming fall of the Naira, rise in the price of goods.

It can be a struggle not falling victim to bankruptcy during the festive season. It&#x2019;s also easy to lose sight of your budget when going out shopping for kids.

As with most financial things in life, budget is key. I like to use the 5 gift rule as a guide to shopping during Christmas for family members and this can be applied when [shopping](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/top-8-surefire-ways-to-shop-smarter-and) for kids. It will help [save money especially if you&#x2019;re on a budget](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/8-practical-ways-to-save-money-by).

The 5 gift rule has been around the internet for a while and there are a few variations of it, the idea is that you need to buy your children no more than five gifts for Christmas.

#### Something to read

This could be a fun inspirational book, a new comic series, a magazine subscription or something that has to do with their career aspirations if you have an older child.
