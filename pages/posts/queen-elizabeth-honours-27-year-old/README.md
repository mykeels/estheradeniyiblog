 Last Friday, Queen Elizabeth II, awarded Nigeria&#x2019;s Anne-Marie Imafidon an MBE, Member of the Order of the&#xA0;British Empire, for her work inspiring the next generation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). According to reports, at 27, Imafidon is the youngest scientist to get a royal recognition since 1890.

 The eldest of&#xA0;[Britain&#x2019;s Brainiest Family](http://www.africaresource.com/arts-a-culture/newsworthy/723-britains-brainiest-family-is-from-nigeria), Imafidon has always been interested in Mathematics, Business and Technology. And has a unique streak of achievements including passing two GCSEs in Mathematics and ICT at the age of 10, being the youngest girl to pass A-level computing at age 11, receiving a British Scholarship to study Mathematics at&#xA0;John Hopkins University&#xA0;at the age of 13, and being one of the youngest to be awarded a Masters&#x2019; degree in Mathematics and Computer Science by the University of Oxford at age 20.

 Imafidon is the CEO and co-founder of Stemettes, an award-winning social enterprise for young girls interested in STEM. She&#xA0;[launched the organisation](http://stemettes.org/blog/2013/02/17/pancakes-paper-and-prizes-the-stemettes-launch/)&#xA0;in February 2013 to bridge the gender gap in STEM after she realised the meagre number of women in the industry. For Imafidon, STEM subjects are not just about solving problems, &#x201C;they can also be used to change people&#x2019;s lives for the better. Tech has been a great leveller and a global tool for good,&#x201D; she stated in an interview with&#xA0;*Parent Info*.

 More than anything, Imafidon serves as a role model to young girls who would otherwise have been unable to see a female figure excelling in the industry. Her organisation has tutored and mentored about 15,000 girls across the UK, Ireland and Europe; proof that she is deserving of the honour of an MBE.

 &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a well done and thank you to my team, our volunteers and those who have taken us seriously over the last four years. This is humbling and a sign of what is to come. Inclusivity in the sector and across society is important for all of us, it&#x2019;s an honour in itself to do the work we do,&#x201D; she said.
