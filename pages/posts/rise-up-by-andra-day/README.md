Since announcing my [new blogging journey](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/life-lately-my-blogging-journey-is?m=1) and the few changes that will effect on my blog, I have been pondering on how to bring in and share my love for music. This is my personal, lifestyle blog and really, I should be able to share what ticks, what inspires, what makes me happy.

So I thought, introducing #CurrentlyOnRepeat isn&#x2019;t a bad idea because, really, you can&#x2019;t separate me, my fun life, actually, from movies and music. I would like to think that this is how I get away.

I am launching this segment of my blog with Rise Up by Andra Day. If you have been following me for a while in here, on Facebook, it is on order it you are like &#x2018;kilode gan na&#x2019;. But, really, I am damn sure I am not the only one obsessed. You take a look at the number of Rise up by Andra day covers all over. Andra Day&#x2019;s songs are really that awesome. Go check on the internet for more.

This is it: I was hoping that this segment will feature new songs I am currently sold out to but as it is, I am currently sold out to &#x2018;Rise up&#x2019;. Subsequent entries will probably be newer songs.

[&#x2018;Rise up&#x2019; by Andra Day](https://m.soundcloud.com/andraday/rise-up) has always been top on my &#x2018;most played&#x2019; Play list. This is because I don&#x2019;t listen to it for just the melody. Yes, there are songs that have earned their spaces there because I can&#x2019;t stop dancing or enjoying the notes. &#x2018;Rise Up&#x2019; by Andra Day is more like my push, my encouragement when I am down and even when I am not.

I told this story several times of how bad my Masters Program was for me resource-wise. I had options to go really out of line, I considered so many things I wouldn&#x2019;t ordinarily have. Yeah, you should be tired of all of that story. &#x2018;Rise Up&#x2019; was what I woke up to listen to everyday. It&#x2019;s back on again and I thought to share this with you.

The lyrics of &#x2018;Rise Up&#x2019; by Andra Day are very powerful, you can find them here below :

You&#x2019;re broken down and tired
 Of living life on a merry go round
 And you can&#x2019;t find the fighter
 But I see it in you so we gonna walk it out
 And move mountains
 We gonna walk it out
 And move mountains

And I&#x2019;ll rise up
 I&#x2019;ll rise like the day
 I&#x2019;ll rise up
 I&#x2019;ll rise unafraid
 I&#x2019;ll rise up
 And I&#x2019;ll do it a thousand times again
 And I&#x2019;ll rise up
 High like the waves
 I&#x2019;ll rise up
 In spite of the ache
 I&#x2019;ll rise up
 And I&#x2019;ll do it a thousands times again
 For you
 For you
 For you
 For you

When the silence isn&#x2019;t quiet
 And it feels like it&#x2019;s getting hard to breathe
 And I know you feel like dying
 But I promise we&#x2019;ll take the world to its feet
 And move mountains
 We&#x2019;ll take it to its feet
 And move mountains

And I&#x2019;ll rise up
 I&#x2019;ll rise like the day
 I&#x2019;ll rise up
 I&#x2019;ll rise unafraid
 I&#x2019;ll rise up
 And I&#x2019;ll do it a thousand times again
 For you
 For you
 For you
 For you

All we need, all we need is hope
 And for that we have each other
 And for that we have each other
 We will rise
 We will rise
 We&#x2019;ll rise, oh oh
 We&#x2019;ll rise

I&#x2019;ll rise up
 Rise like the day
 I&#x2019;ll rise up
 In spite of the ache
 I will rise a thousands times again
 And we&#x2019;ll rise up
 Rise like the waves
 We&#x2019;ll rise up
 In spite of the ache
 We&#x2019;ll rise up
 And we&#x2019;ll do it a thousands times again
 For you oh oh oh oh oh
 For you oh oh oh oh oh
 For you oh oh oh oh oh
 For you
