Just recently, I was complaining about how no primer seemed to work for my oily skin. I thought I was alone until I watched Omabelle on YouTube share her own struggles with her oily skin. I was comforted, to say the least and oh well, that there is a solution to making up on this massive oil producing face is such a relief.

But then, you want your makeup to stay longer on your oily skin. What you can do is to put your oily skin under control.

So many strategies have been cooked up to help people like us with oily skin apply makeup without this much stress.

So I recently figured out few steps & products that have helped my oily skin tremendously. Hope you all enjoy!&#x201D;
