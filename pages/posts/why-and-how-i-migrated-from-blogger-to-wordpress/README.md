**Migrating from Blogger to WordPress** for me was a very big leap. If I were to use other adjectives, I would go for huge, immense, serious, gigantic. I graduated from the roller coaster of deciding whether to finally move or not to the point of the actual move.

If you have been a blogger friend of mine, you know how stubborn I was with Blogspot. You may not get to see me expressly talk about my deep love for Blogspot on my blog because I am always an advocate of using what works best for you. I believe that if Blogspot works best for you after you have considered its pros and cons, go for it.

I don&#x2019;t subscribe to going with the popular opinion just because. You should understand the advantages and disadvantages of both Blogger and WordPress, compare these to what stage you are as a Blogger and what you&#x2019;d like to achieve and then make an informed decision.

I have had people who went for WordPress from the beginning of their blogging ride. I have also had (including me) who preferred to play safe, minimize costs and stay with Blogger. Blogger was a great platform for me, until&#x2026;

A lot of people have complained about its primitiveness as compared to WordPress. That, I do not disagree with. Another complaint is how difficult it is to design and have a very beautiful blog without having to learn how to code. That I agree with too. If you do not know basic coding, you are going to have a basic blog with stunted functionality. If you, however, want a blogger blog with a stunning design and great functionality, you either have to learn some coding or outsource to a blog designer. I can do that for you, by the way.

## But what&#x2019;s so special about Blogger anyway?

&#xA0;

### 1. Blogger is very cost effective

Imagine that I don&#x2019;t have to think of hosting every year. All I have to renew is my domain name. Also contacting a professional designer is just once in a very long while. In just one swoop, I am having a one-time investment except for domain name.

### 2. It is very easy to use

I know of clients who just want &#x201C;plug and play&#x201D;. Take care of everything else, I just want to be able to log on to my dashboard, post and connect with my readers. With blogger, it is damn easy. As long as your blog is set up, all you need to do is write and publish.

### 3. Nobody is having hypertension over hosting issue

You see,&#xA0; if you are a high goal Blogger who is looking to have tons and tons of traffic, quality hosting can be quite expensive. On Blogger, you don&#x2019;t have that hypertension. Some people usually want to cheat the system, they go for low quality hosting a.k.a untrustworthy Nigerian hosting but it usually ends up so bad. Some have had to forget their blogs.

I am so tempted to mention names here but I am going to try to restrain myself now.&#xA0; Checked a friend&#x2019;s blog some hours ago and realized that it&#x2019;s down. I don&#x2019;t want to even imagine how much of sad she is going to be right now with the yeye Nigerian host she is using. She&#x2019;s complained over and over and to think that their customer service is extremely poor! One of these hosting platforms is everywhere gallivanting, doing Ads and sponsoring shows. But their platform is so so, gosh, frustrating.

## Why did I move from Blogger to WordPress?

Some people have already seen the changes. Some knew right from when I began the process. A lot of questions are thrown at me right, left and center (especially given that I love Blogger so much).&#xA0; I still love Blogger very much, but here are the reasons why I had to migrate from Blogger to WordPress.

### SEO

As some of you know, I am an SEO (Search Engine&#xA0; Optimization) kind of Blogger. My journey into a [proper understanding of SEO](https://estheradeniyi.com/best-seo-tips-for-bloggers/) started real deep at the beginning of this year when I took up a job as an SEO Analyst. I had to be put on probation for a while as I had a lot of technical SEO to learn. I would say I was an intern in the sense of that word.

I have therefore learned a lot of things on this job. I have been able to internalize what I have gained as experience and apply them on my blog. I was later to discover, however, that Blogger is stiff in many areas of search engine optimization.

Take for example, the permalink structure. In simple English, this means the URL format. It&#x2019;s so stiff that editing in a custom way only comes after the permanent &#x2018;month&#x2019; configuration.

Root domain name/2018/04/post title

For your posts to rank better, your URL structure is very important. I wanted to be able to go straight to optimizing without having the stiff nature of Blogger&#x2019;s permalinks.

It&#x2019;s important to mention here that there are so many ranking factors, more than 200 of them. Your permalink structure just happens to be one. If other things are good and you edit your Blogger&#x2019;s permalink well, you can still rank well and even above your competition.

I have gone into professional blogging sort of, and I would like to experiment on so many things and with so many elements. WordPress, I must say, is the [foundation of professional Blogging](https://estheradeniyi.com/top-5-skills-to-become-problogger/) and search engine optimization study.

### Blogger&#x2019;s https provision was becoming very annoying

This is where y&#x2019;all are going to have to conclude that my migrating from Blogger to WordPress is more technical than otherwise lol. Sometimes being the tech girl has caused me to forget how to do simple things like relax and just write content.

So,&#xA0; it seems to me that Blogger was not going to move forward technical wise. Their http blogs kept on being blocked my spectra net and some other internet providers. Their SSL feature was no better! Blogger is owned by Google. It is this same Google that it mounting pressure on webmasters. They are favoring sites with https over those without.

I understand the need to get sites more secure and the enforcement by making its compliance a ranking factor (still SEO talk right here, sighs), why they aren&#x2019;t making their platforms the best of this in this regard is baffling.

Yes, I get it, free comes at a price. I so get it. I mean, with a free hosting, free this, free that, free SSL, I get it but if they want to make some features premium, they could simply go ahead and do that so that we get the best of that feature.&#xA0; I hope to God I am not the only one mad at this singular issue.

### I&#xA0; am hoping to add some more functionality

In the nearest future, I want to add e-commerce. I want all of its features and I want them plug and play. You can have a store on blogger but some stiff third party will be involved. I don&#x2019;t know if I also want to begin to code my store into existence. I want easy and swift.

With WordPress, I can do that easily. There are also other functionalities that Blogger may limit me for. With Blogger at the time, I had pretty everything I needed until I began to think more professionally.

### I needed an excuse to rebrand (again)

So, a while back, I decided to put up posts about just blogging, social media and other blogging resources that would help bloggers grow and faster too. Before I made the switch, I sought opinions and while a smaller fraction of people really wanted me to consider sticking to lifestyle generally, a larger fraction were all in for blogging posts only.

I made the switch but realized that it might have been a mistake. Yes, engagement increased but my audience drastically went down which is most expected of [niched blogs](https://estheradeniyi.com/choose-blogging-niche-or-no/). Some of my fanatical readers (I am so blessed and honored and grateful to have these lots) spoke up. Even the ones who originally supported my going all in to only blogging posts said they would not mind having lifestyle posts back in.

After giving this a thought and because I realize we are on this journey together, I reincorporated lifestyle back in. I am not writing my blog for myself only. Inasmuch as it is an avenue for me to express myself too, of what use is the platform if I am not connecting with my readers?

While switching from Blogger to WordPress, I decided to push the re-branding too. I made some of the major categories clearer and more pronounced. You can see that with the static sliders just before the actual blog feed.

## How I moved from Blogger to WordPress

&#xA0;

![How I migrated from blogger to wordpress](images\How-I-migrated-from-blogger-to-wordpress-1.png)

### 1. Hosting

So, the almighty hosting. See, I can&#x2019;t afford to have hosting that will make my blog up today and down tomorrow. So, I decided that if I was going to do WordPress, I was going to do it right once and for all.&#xA0; No need for akagum attitude that will be stressing me.

I always had Bluehost in mind but I was sold on [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/recommended?referrer_id=7825658) the first time Helene of Heleneinbetween talked about them. I had gone online to read reviews from so many reputable sites and the close alternative to Bluehost for them was SiteGround. I decided to give this a shot and I must say that the service has been so excellent. Every time I hit the chat button to chat them up,&#xA0; they are with me almost immediately.

So, first thing, get your hosting. Please do this with a reputable site. It&#x2019;s so important. There is no point using [WordPress.org](http://Wordpress.org) with crappy hosting.

Another really great hosting I use for my clients is Hostgator. This is one of the best that you can find because it is cheap and redirection is so seamless. If you are just starting out, you might want to go for them.

As soon as you begin the process, every step of the way is extremely easy, so easy anyone who is smart phone literate can do this.

It is also one of the cheapest with the most quality out there. Speaking of their uptime, it is 24/7/365. Really great hosting to use.

[Click here to get started](http://partners.hostgator.com/grMPB)!

If you ever have issues getting started with HostGator, just send me an email (esther.adeniyi@gmail.com) or comment below this post. I will jump right in to &#x201C;save you&#x201D;. Aha!

### 2. Blogger import and redirection

I backed up my blogger files and imported to WordPress. I thereafter did a redirection. All of this took two days as I had to wait for my DNS to propagate before starting a redirection.

### 3. Design

I installed my theme and began to redesign my blog. It was pretty fun doing that. Oh my, so fun. Design just lights up my face as it involves a lot of experimenting. I installed necessary plugins and set up other necessary things and here, my first post using WordPress.

So guys, there it is, why and how I switched from Blogger to WordPress. If you would like me to do it for you without having you lose your blog files and rankings, I am just an email away.

So tell me, if you are a Blogger, what blogging platform do you prefer?&#xA0; Blogger or WordPress,&#xA0; why?
