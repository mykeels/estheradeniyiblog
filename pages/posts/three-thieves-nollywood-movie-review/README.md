## Three Thieves Nollywood Movie Trailer

&#xA0;

## Synopsis

Frustrated with their current standard of living, three young men decide to find a desperate solution to their poverty. This resolve is easy as they are mistakenly tasked with a robbery job. This, with its financial reward, falls so easily into their laps and they are left with no other sane choice than to go for it. What was supposed to land them in prison ends up making them heroes of the day.&#xA0;

## Three Thieves Movie Review

**Three Thieves** is a fantastic Nollywood comedy. The comedy was served with grace and expertise. When everyone in the cinema is reeking of laughter; deep, loud laughter, the only good guess is that everyone on the movie team did not come to play.

Every second in [Three Thieves](https://threethievesmovie.com/) was a hilarious outburst of skillful comedy. There was absolutely no time to be bored. It started off effortlessly funny and left us comfortably satiated.

If you are the hard guy in your clique or have vowed to never be impressed by any Nollywood comedy, well, Three Thieves is going to be your first. If this doesn&#x2019;t evoke laughter patterns you have never heard from yourself, you must have too many life troubles.&#xA0;

I must warn you, there were ridiculously unrealistic scenes but for the joy of ticket money well spent, they were easy to forgive and explain away. If you ever catch yourself giving excuses for why an utterly impossible movie scene is slightly possible, you have been bought!

## Acting

The three thieves, **Frank Donga, Shawn Faqua, Koye-kekere Ekun** were fabulous. Their ability to naturally at in their roles was elegant. They had a synergy that was fulfilling to watch. Nothing forced, very easy on the eye.&#xA0;

**Shaffy Bello** is making me fall in love with her, no homo! First, it was [Love is War](https://estheradeniyi.com/love-is-war-nollywood-movie-review/) and then, this. This woman is an excellent actress. She delivers with a finesse that is admirable. The way she owns her part leaves no room for doubt. Damn, she&#x2019;s good.

Something about **Odunlade Adekola** can&#x2019;t keep people calm. He seems to have a large real estate in the heart of many Nigerians in the case of comedy.&#xA0;

Child-star, **Angel Unigwe** is definitely one to watch out for.

Everyone was on point!
