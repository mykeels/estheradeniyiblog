Did you miss The Voice Nigeria battles on Sunday? Watch the recap online here:

Toh Bad by Niniola rendered by Majekaa and Wolei was my best. The Chemistry on that team Yemi was on fire! Their voices were in so much of synergy. Their voices were powerful! I knew deep down within me that the audience and the judges saw it. None of them was going home. They were both so very good on that stage. I am watching out for both of them in this season.

What do you think? Which team performed the most?
