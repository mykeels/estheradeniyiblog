 Question of the week is back and today I want to know if you can pop the question as a lady. It&#x2019;s not that you will come here and say you don&#x2019;t know what I am talking about o. I mean, propose. Can you propose to a man?

If you are a man, how would you feel having a woman propose to you? Indifferent, concerned, emasculated, blackmailed, insufficient ?

Let me hear your thoughts in the comments section guys. How is the weekend going?
