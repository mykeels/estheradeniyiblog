N. B: 1. If the semo texture is too thick for you while still preparing it, &#xA0;you can add little water either hot or cold and allow it to boil, then stir again. This time around you don&#x2019;t have to add any more Semo.

2. Do not make the texture of your semo to be too thick because the more it gets cold, &#xA0;the more it becomes thick/hard.
