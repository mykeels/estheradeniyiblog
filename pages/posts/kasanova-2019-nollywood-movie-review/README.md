I didn&#x2019;t enjoy **Kasanova**. It&#x2019;s okay, you can shoot me. I mean, reviews seem to be more positive than negative but sorry, I can&#x2019;t deal.

I get it, your favorite Nollywood actors are in Kasanova but hear me out, please.

The comedy part of this Romcom was the bomb but the romance churned my belly. I just couldn&#x2019;t flow with the whole vibe. You can watch the movie teaser below and continue with the review if I haven&#x2019;t succeeded in pissing you off just yet.&#xA0;

## Kasanova Movie Teaser

&#xA0;

## Kasanova Synopsis

Having lost his wife, Femi finds it very difficult to get over her. He turns to flimsy relationships and careless flings. His son, Jason picks interest in music and finds himself a mentor and a coach. He ends up falling for Jessica&#x2019;s daughter. Femi, on the other hand, takes his love life seriously.

## The Story&#xA0;

**Kasanova** was boring for me. I didn&#x2019;t very much enjoy the story. The twist was expected and the ending, lazy. Kasanova could have done better. Stories like these are better narrated than seen in a movie cinema. Nothing spectacular or worth fussing over. End of story!

## Acting&#xA0;

Everyone who was supposed to be funny in Kasanova was hell funny. The comedy was top notch. **Helen Paul** was 100%. I loved watching the short time she popped up on the screen. It felt as though **Ruby Akubueze** was trying not to forget her lines, her acting was bland and boring. **Toyin Abraham** never disappoints, she was awesome. Maybe **Ireti Doyle** should never be on the piano in subsequent movies.&#xA0;

## Kasanova Nollywood Movie Cast

Wale Ojo as Femi
 Alvin Abayomi as Jason
 Toyin Abraham as Bisola
 Ruby Akubueze as Ini

## Conclusion

If you don&#x2019;t have any other movie you are currently dying to watch, then maybe Kasanova can help you pass time.&#xA0;
