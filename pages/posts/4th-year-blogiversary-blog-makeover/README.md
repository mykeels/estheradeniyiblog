 If you are my friend on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/adeniyi.esther.583), jumping around over my blog today (again) is definitely going to get you pissed but I will do it. I want to scream and shout on the mountain tops. I want the whole world to know that I stayed with this for four years; that I survived it despite the ups and downs.

I launched my first post on March 16, 2013. I don&#x2019;t know if I am still proud of that poem but I have evolved (and that&#x2019;s what matters). I had opened my blog before that, sometime in February that year. I can&#x2019;t exactly remember the date. Little did I know that celebrating blog anniversaries would be a thing. I therefore chose the date I published my first post. My first blog, The Nigerian Student, I opened in 2011. I was such a newbie. I knew practically nothing, the blogosphere was also very scanty. I had to learn too many things on my own and ehn, see I started with Nokia Asha 302. This is why I tell new bloggers that you don&#x2019;t need that many gadgets and tech stuff. All you need are a browser phone (preferably, Android) and an internet subscription.

Blogging has been a lot of fun for me. I have had the opportunity to meet people like you. I have been able to connect with people from far and near; from different walks of life. I have had to learn how to design a beautiful blog (I can still advertise here right? Contact me if you want something superb). I have [made some money from blogging](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-do-i-earn-money-as-blogger). They come in trickles but it&#x2019;s all I need to stay happy as a blogger. I can only hope for more financial rewards.

Today, in celebration of my 4th blog anniversary, I will be hosting a giveaway. You can comment below for a chance to win a blog makeover (blogspot blogs only) or review (any blog). Submit your blog addresses to enter. You don&#x2019;t have to be a blogger, you can have a blogger friend whose life you want to bless today. I will pick the blog I will be designing by myself. So, leggo&#x2026;

Thank you very much for being a part of my success. Thank you for reading my blog posts. Thank you for accommodating my excesses. I want to specially thank contributing writers on my blog over time. Emeka, thank you, I can&#x2019;t thank you enough. Olufunmbi, kisses. Yele, my darling, &#x2018;unserious&#x2019; fellow, I love you.

Cheers to us, we made it to 4.
