Instagram is a tough nut to crack and while I am still trying to figure out a lot of things as regards the Instagram algorithm and getting as much as I can from the social platform, I want to share with you what I do to get more people to comment on my Instagram posts. Please [follow me on Instagram here](https://www.instagram.com/estheradeniyisblog/). I promise that it will be worth your while!

One of the reasons why commenting is a big deal for me is that I count it to be the best form of engagement. It takes a lot of interest to stop by and then pass comments on Instagram.

Another reason I love to receive comments would be an assurance that I make sense. I know, I know, you want to share but if the people you are sharing with or creating content for do not like your posts, I strongly believe that there is no point at all.

So, for me, seeing comments under my Instagram posts reassures me, at least, someone out there still thinks my posts are worth coming up on their Instagram feed.

Many people, like me, would rather &#x201C;like&#x201D; the post. Maybe, tag a friend who they think the post resonates with but to actually write a meaningful comment, it must be that:

i. the post strikes a chord

ii. they most definitely want to lend their opinions or

iii. the post is naturally engaging, thought-provoking or very funny.

There are so many tips on the internet to help you increase Instagram comments and they all work. I, however, want to share what nobody is talking about as it is a lesser-shared tip. How do you get people to comment on your Instagram posts?

The key to having people engage with you in this manner is to cause a natural relationship between you and your followers, so much that they naturally gravitate towards you, your thoughts and your personality.

What you want to do is establish and maintain a constant conversation between you and your followers. The kind of conversation that goes way beyond just responding to comments. This is a tough job if I must be sincere with you.

But I can tell you something for free, apart from the fact that you will be able to get them to trust you and like you and be interested in your posts, you will build some relationships that will go way beyond Instagram. I have built tens of these.

*This is how I prioritize who to interact with.*

I go back to posts of 7 days ago, click on everyone who has commented on my post and like some of their posts, comment genuinely on two of them. Commenting on too many will come off as spamming them.

It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it is just one person who commented, do the same. After a while, you will begin to have an increase because new people will join in to comment, old people you have interacted with your posts will comment.

Plus haven&#x2019;t you noticed that people like to comment on what other people have commented on? This is why we have IG pods. It is to encourage your followers to comment.

Now, when I mean commenting genuinely, I mean that you look for specific things to say about the picture. Don&#x2019;t write things like, &#x201C;nice picture&#x201D; etc. Write actual things that make it a nice picture. Do you like the shoe, the bag, the hair, the way the picture was edited, the background? Maybe you want to answer the question that was asked in the caption or contribute to the discussion?

Some of the people who have commented on your posts may not be active on IG when you check them out. Their last post may be in 2018 or 2017, for those ones, just give them power likes. Like many of their pictures. They may even feature you in their stories for liking their pictures. You establish communication and at the same time get a free feature.

Every day, I go back to the last 7 days, check out my post and interact. Heck, sometimes, I even dm some of the people I am really really interested in. Say, they have something I need.

1. One, you will show up more in their feed by commenting on theirs and given that they have once commented on yours before&#x2026;

2. You build a good rapport with your followers which is what social media is for.

3. You get them genuinely interested in you. People do not really like to comment on Instagram. They would prefer to just double-tap and scroll on. There are so many pictures to see.

When they see your next picture, they will stop. They may not comment but they will &#x201C;like&#x201D;. The likelihood of them commenting however has been increased, trust me. They may not comment today, but they will do so tomorrow especially if they really like the post.

On the issue of responding to comments, do not be flimsy. I see people responding to comment with a &#x201C;heart&#x201D;. That is your chance to build rapport with ease. Write full sentences. Answer comments in a way that you are able to get a response back.

Be interesting and heavily engaging, in a sensible way though. This means, not belaboring conversations or overstaying your welcome. Let them leave your wall with high spirits and on a high note.

In short, intelligence is not only about books, but there is also social intelligence. I have met a couple of socially intelligent people on Facebook and Instagram. These people treat numbers like actual people. If you had 30 likes, count it as 30 people thumbing you up.

Don&#x2019;t see them as just stats, see them as actual people you can interact with and don&#x2019;t forget that even one person has their own network too. You can reach hundreds of people with just one person. Imagine with 30 people, who like you, are interested in you and are passionate about your brand.

I would like to also know, what strategies do you use to get people to comment on your Instagram posts? Please kindly share in the comments section below.
