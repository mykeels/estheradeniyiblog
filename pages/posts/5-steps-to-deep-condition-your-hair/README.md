Shey you know that I can&#x2019;t hide it anymore, coconut oil is my best when it comes to products. I use it as my normal hair cream sometimes. What I majorly use it for is for deep conditioning. There is actually one obvious reason I am sentimental about coconut oil- the smell. Of all the essential oils for natural hair, I love the smell of coconut oil the most. In fact, I go pick the bottle to bask in the smell on some occasions. Hihihihihihihihihihi&#x2026;.

The other natural product I love is shea butter.[The benefits of shea butter](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/natural-hair-3-benefits-of-shea-butter)are endless. It is my body cream as we speak. Some people get to worry about the smell of shea butter but I will tell you here in this blog post that it is quickly absorbed by the skin. In minutes it has penetrated into your skin and you don&#x2019;t have to worry about the smell. This is to help you dispel the misconception about the smell, just in case you are considering making it a body cream or hair cream.

Let me quickly tell you the benefits of deep conditioning your hair :

it helps your hair become softer over time. If you have a spongy texture, begin to look into deep conditioning.

it helps your hair retain more moisture.

it helps your hair shine more. You know how dull natural hair can be na.

it also adds more elasticity to your hair. This will help to avoid the frequent breakage due to brittleness.

Okay, so, how to deep condition with coconut oil:

First, I want you to know that many of the coconut oil bottles we see in the market contain adulterated versions. You should try to be sure that you are getting a pure version of coconut oil. It wasn&#x2019;t like this before. You could vouch for natural materials but oh well, people are opportunists, they want to make all the money these days.

If you however [want to make your own coconut oil,](http://www.nigerianfoodtv.com/2015/10/homemade-coconut-oil-how-to-make.html?m=1)click on the pink link to see how.

Now, let&#x2019;s get to the steps:

Step 1- Massage coconut oil into your dry or moist hair. I prefer doing this on damp hair because it gets absorbed easily. So, start from the ends and work to your roots. If you have dry scalp, it might be an advantage to massage on your scalp too. Your natural hair oils are okay if you have oily hair.

Step 2- Wrap your hair in a shower cap. Use a towel to seal everything in place.

Step 3- Leave it like that for 30 minutes. I go longer when I use coconut oil sometimes, I however don&#x2019;t do that when I am using my deep conditioner. I used to use my 30 minutes to arrange my bag and organize what I would be wearing when I was in school. Now ehn, I just roam about the house. Chai.

Step 4- Rinse your hair and shampoo and condition normally.

Step 5- Towel or air dry. Do not squeeze your hair. You can just wrap your towel around your hair.

Have you tried [deep conditioning with coconut oil ](http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/how-to-make-a-coconut-oil-deep-conditioner-for-your-hair)before. Will you try this sometime?
