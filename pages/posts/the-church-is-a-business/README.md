I started this topic on my WhatsApp status but I decided to make this into a heartfelt blog post because I am not able to say all that I want to say within the confines of the word count allocated to Whatsapp status.

I also want you to not see this as a rant. This is just me pouring out my heart. I believe that some of us are genuinely ignorant about the affairs of the church and as such say things or behave in a way that is malicious and detrimental to her progress, even as Christians.

The Church of God is a business.

See what Jesus says in Luke 2:49 (NKJV) And He said to them, &#x201C;Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father&#x2019;s business?&#x201D;

For every normal organization, there is a hierarchy and a process. If it were not so, things won&#x2019;t function well, nothing will work. At its most mundane level, the church has to spend money on rent (or land), they have to buy chairs and fans (or AC). The church buildings you see did not suddenly appear. Bricklayers were paid in cash, plumbers were paid too.

In the spiritual sense, there is competition &#x2013; the gates of hell, distraction, the world, etc. In short, the church is a business. Manna will not fall from heaven. God uses human beings to provide funds to work for him as Pastors. God cannot come down to be doing all of these, he died for us, that&#x2019;s enough. We have to be responsible too.

I know that Pastors do not come out to discuss this. I also know that some of them use really sneaky means to get the money. I wish they really explained properly to people. Instead of the sneaky ones asking for money for prayers.

When you go to church to use the fan, have you ever thought of how it got there? Money bought the fan. Some people even come to church to charge their phones because they do not have electricity at home. The church&#x2019;s gen was bought with money. It is also not running on water.

There is also this case of people asking Pastors to go and work. I say we are a bunch of people who demand and ask for everything! Your Pastor prepares the sermon, spends a lot of time to receive what he has to deliver in prayers, attends to challenges that his members have both spiritual and temporal. Some of us will even call them up as early as 2 am when issues arise.

This man (or woman) then comes up to deliver the Word (Public and motivational speakers are paid for this, just saying). This same man (or woman) is the one that directs the affairs of the church, more like the CEO. Being a CEO is tasking.

You will manage people, hold several meetings on how and where the church money goes next. What direction the household of God takes next as a people. There are so many other tasks these Pastors do that no one else ever talks about.

Some of them are busy all week round feeding the flock. Asking them to take up the same 9 to 5 as you is really unfair. While you go back home to rest after work, theirs continue. some work as late as 1 am. Even while they are resting, they are wired to expect any call.

Don&#x2019;t forget that the 21st century Pastor has to be equipped. He won&#x2019;t tell you, &#x201C;The Lord is good&#x201D; when you come to him for career advice. He has to be sound enough to give you practical advice. This man has to be versatile, he has to read, he has to be equipped.

He also needs to know what is happening in the world if he must address the issues. He needs to be able to relate with his members in the generation that he is in. It is a lot of work to be a Pastor.

Have you considered the many people that he has to &#x201C;endure&#x201D;? Some of us are selfish and demanding, have you considered those ones? Yet, you want him to also go to work like you and come back home to continue working.

If you saw your Pastor as a man with an honorable occupation, as one that spends time to nurture your soul and spirit, you would contribute to his success.

1 Corinthians 9:14 &#x2013; Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.

**[Malachi 3:10](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Malachi-3-10/)**&#xA0;&#x2013; Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that [there shall] not [be room] enough [to receive it].

There is a reason why there should be meat in God&#x2019;s house. God&#x2019;s men are not to starve because they are called. I know that some of them have done things that we question, things that make us doubt their calling, but really, have you stopped to ask why?

Someone is asking for money before he prays for you, he is hungry. No meat in the House he is managing. He has gone about it the wrong way, I know but here I am, telling you what&#x2019;s behind that.

For those who argue that the church should not be given to, they would rather give to the needy than to the church -ask these people when they last gave to the needy. The beggers at Ikeja Under Bridge, have they given to these folks? In fact, when they eventually give, they would take pictures, post on social media. Everyone must know that they gave.

I know that giving is sacrificial, it is not easy. So, we should not cover up our selfishness and attempt to detract the guys who believe in giving.

The profit of this business is that souls are saved, lives are transformed. God has a channel readily available to work. However, if everything goes unsupervised, imagine the state of anarchy that this business (God&#x2019;s business) will be in.

I just want us to begin to look at the church as the spiritual organization that must work. It won&#x2019;t work automatically. It will not operate with faith and prayers. The Lord has entrusted this job to vessels and these vessels must be responsible.

They must be sound enough to treat this sacred business with wisdom and tact. Any time you have someone say they would rather give to the needy than to the church, ask them not to sit on the chairs or bring theirs from home.
