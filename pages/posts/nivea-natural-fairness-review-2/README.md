&#xA0;

On Instagram, I have become the &#x201C;official ambassador&#x201D; for **Nivea Natural Fairness**. You should see the way I talk about this lotion like I am the co-owner. This has stemmed from the fact that I have waited so long to find what compliments my skin so well. Combining Nivea Natural Fairness lotion with my [newly discovered Dove Beauty Bar](https://estheradeniyi.com/my-dove-beauty-bar-review/) has produced the best of results so far.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

I wanted to talk about **Nivea Natural Fairness on Instagram** only and just leave it as that but my blog readers are already screaming. They say they want me to come back to inserting a few lifestyle posts once in a while. I am game, it&#x2019;s fine. This is our blog and really, I have learned to listen to blog readers.

&#xA0;

My mum came home one day with Nivea Natural Fairness. Shortly before that, I realized that she had been coming home with different types of body creams. These civil servants, someone will recommend something to them and off, they go to buy it. They don&#x2019;t care if it works or not. This was how she came home with Dudu Osun and it was not even in units, she bought a whole pack fam.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

Okay, thing is that [the African Black soap](https://estheradeniyi.com/african-black-soap/) is this close to competing with my Dove Beauty Bar. [Dudu Osun is the only African Black soap brand](https://estheradeniyi.com/african-black-soap/) I have tried ever, so I would recommend this to anyone. It was all shades of awesome while I used it. I particularly loved the smell. Anyway, back to Nivea Natural Fairness.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

Apparently, my mum&#x2019;s colleague had sweet-mouthed Nivea Natural Fairness so much that she could not help but buy it. I know my mum, she is extremely critical of the word &#x201C;fairness&#x201D;. So, I could beat my chest to say that she had done her research, asked questions and what-not&#x2019;s.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

From where did y&#x2019;all think I would have gotten the nerve, the boldness to use anything &#x201C;fairness&#x201D;? I talked about this lotion on Facebook and some equally extra careful and critical friends voiced their concerns too.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

## Does Nivea Natural Fairness Bleach the Skin?

&#xA0;

To answer this question, I think it&#x2019;s important to know how it works. One thing about me is that I use Google a lot. So, when there are too many concerns about anything, I am on that search engine straightaway, no time.

&#xA0;

#### Nivea Natural Fairness works using two mechanisms

&#xA0;

First mechanism: It reduces or slows down the pigmentation of the skin. Well, some of you know that I did Chemistry in school, it&#x2019;s in my&#xA0;[About](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/p/about.html), lol. Two of the active ingredients added to this lotion are licorice extract and&#xA0; Octadecenedioic acid.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

Now, these active ingredients work to induce skin lightening by acting in the tyrosinase produced by the body. Tyrosinase is actually the enzyme responsible for melanin production.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

Second mechanism (which some are more familiar with): It acts as UV protection. It&#x2019;s a simple analogy. The sun in this part of the world is terrible. If you had seen me when I was in Ilorin, Christ! I was &#x201C;black&#x201D;. Black like charcoal.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

So, Nivea Natural Fairness has sunscreens added to the formula and this protects the skin from the UV rays. UV rays, of course, you know are one major factor responsible for darkening of the skin. If a cream is repelling them from penetrating, you can be sure that the natural skin&#x2019;s fairness will come back to light and be retained.

&#xA0;

## Nivea Natural Fairness Ingredients

&#xA0;

Aqua, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Fragaria Ananassa Fruit Juice, Rubus Fruticosus Juice, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Oleic Acid, Silica, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Sodium Carbomer, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylparaben, Methylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Benzyl Salicylate, Coumarin, Citral, BHT, Parfum

## Things I love About Nivea Natural Fairness

&#xA0;

Of course, the fact that I am not doomed to a life of black is one of the best things I love about Nivea Natural Fairness. Now, this lotion is not just only effective but soft to my skin, it [makes my skin glow](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/diy-skin-glow-recipes-lets-get-it). I like the feel of this lotion when I rub it on my skin. The smell too. The smell of Nivea Natural Fairness is just so pleasant. It&#x2019;s so pleasant that you would like to smell like that all day. I hear that there is a Nivea Natural Fairness soap and deodorant.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

I one time asked about this deodorant from the guy I buy my cosmetics from. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to know that it exists. I checked Jumia however for it and found the pack. I will put this to mind and actually order or look for a bigger store. Shoprite, maybe, they may have it.

&#xA0;

## What I don&#x2019;t like about Nivea Natural Fairness

I am updating this part of the post on the 12th of January, 2019. Original publish date was March 30th, 2018. This is approximately 10 months later of consistent use of Nivea Natural Fairness lotion.

This has given me enough time to figure out what I don&#x2019;t like about the lotion.

It leaves my limbs white after a while. I know that this is supposed to be deeply moisturizing but after a while, I notice whitening of my feet.

You know the whitening that makes it look like you didn&#x2019;t even use body cream before leaving your house? The harmattan kind of whitening? That&#x2019;s the type I am referring to.

So I usually apply a whole lot of lotion to my feet especially. Even at that, when I pull my legs out of my heels at work, my feet become white. I don&#x2019;t like that part of Nivea Natural Fairness.

&#xA0;

## How much is Nivea Natural Fairness in Nigeria

It bought mine for N 1,560. Actually, mumsy bought it. I had told her that I was going to pay her so she should help me buy it. The excuse I gave was that I would love to buy the original one as I cannot identify the fake Nivea lotion. Of course, it worked!

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

I wasn&#x2019;t returning any money. I collected lotion and winked at her. She didn&#x2019;t even bother, she said she knew I wasn&#x2019;t giving her back her money, so no fuss. That trick is used up, it can&#x2019;t ever work next time. Whatever.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

No matter how expensive it is where you want to get it, be sure that it won&#x2019;t exceed 2,000 Naira. So, just budget 1500-2000 Naira for Nivea Natural Fairness body lotion.

&#xA0;

## How long does it take for Nivea Natural Fairness to work?

&#xA0;

I would say that it depends on your skin and I think body types. In two weeks, I saw a visible change. For some, it takes up to three or more or even lesser weeks. The reason why the change was more visible for me was that I used it morning and night. I actually apply Nivea Natural Fairness lotion on my body lightly at night before I sleep. I feel that that might have influenced the quick results.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

When I collected the lotion from my mum, it wasn&#x2019;t even because I wanted to become fairer. I did because mine was finished and I just wanted to use a Nivea product. Nivea is class, my people. I was happy when I discovered that there was more to it than just being a body lotion.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

I finally left the [Vaseline body cream](https://estheradeniyi.com/these-vaseline-beauty-hacks-will-make/) levels to Nivea. I don&#x2019;t know which one is a higher level but babes, I am so satisfied where I am. I said this when I was using Vaseline and the likes tho&#x2019;.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

## How to spot fake Nivea Cream/ How to Identify the original Nivea Natural Fairness

A lot of people ask of **how to differentiate between the fake and original Nivea cream**. I don&#x2019;t blame anyone trying to know how to spot the fake Nivea cream or **clearly identify the original Nivea natural fairness**, this is our skin we are talking about here. Truth is that there may not be one answer fits all, this is why you may need to know the original to spot the fake Nivea cream. So, I have been using the vanilla essence, for example for so long that I can spot the fake one in my dream. One, the green cap would be slightly faded and then the smell! This is probably my first test. It&#x2019;s usually a strong and offensive alcoholic smell.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

For Nivea, anything off, you should know it is fake. People say that the blue cover, for the products that have blue, will be slightly faded. I still believe that you should have been familiar, at least a little bit with the original to spot this. Also, the texture of the cream in the fake would be very different. It may form some bubbles when you rub it on your skin. It is in fact, very watery.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

My advice is that you buy from credible stores. There are also Nivea retail and wholesale outlets in some parts of the country. I saw one on my way to Onipanu from Yaba the other day. It is not on the main road, I found it while the bus was going through the interiors.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

You can also ask someone who knows what the original&#xA0;looks like to buy it for you or go with you or just buy Nivea creams from Shoprite, Justrite, Nivea retail outlets or just any other credible store.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

## Side effect of Nivea Natural Fairness

This part of the post is also being updated today, January 12th, 2019.

I apply Nivea Natural Fairness on my face when I apply on my body. Now, what I am about to say, it might not be a side effect for you.

Remember that this review is entirely from personal usage and experience using the lotion. Although, some parts are researched to enable me pass accurate information, the rest of the review is personal and experiential.

So, I went home for the Christmas holiday and my whole family terribly complained about my dark undereyes. Yo, they were so dark! I saw them but took my mind off.

Even though I packed my Nivea Natural Fairness home, I didn&#x2019;t use it because I was drawn to my sister&#x2019;s Nivea cocoa butter body lotion.

I did a [review of Nivea cocoa butter body lotion here](https://estheradeniyi.com/nivea-cocoa-butter-body-lotion-review/). I plan to update it very soon because as at the time I wrote it, all I was exposed to was the smell. I didn&#x2019;t know too much about it.

So I went on to research, I asked my friends who used it for a review. Be rest assured that they gave me sincere and honest information about Nivea cocoa butter body lotion.

But now that I have begun to use it, it&#x2019;s been three weeks now, I will go in for a better review, at least, a more personal one.

As I was saying, I switched to Nivea cocoa butter and in three days, under eye blackness was gone.

I am not sure it&#x2019;s safe to authoritatively conclude that black undereye is a **side effect of Nivea Natural Fairness** after a very long time but I did have that as a side effect on my face.

## Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant

This is an update on **Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant**. It&#x2019;s August 6 today and it&#x2019;s two months I have used it for now. I just though I could do an update and tell you most of what you might or need to know.

### Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant Ingredients

Aqua, Aluminium Chlorohydrate, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether, Steareth-2, Steareth-21, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana Distillate, Persea Gratissima Oil, Panthenol, Trisodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Benzophenone-4, Polysorbate 20, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Parfum

### What I like About Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant

For one, the smell of Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant is long lasting. I have used four other Nivea deodorants. **The Invisible Black and White Clear Roll-on, Pearl, Nivea roll on for men and Beauty Nivea deodorant and Nivea Energy Fresh**. The Black and White is long lasting but Energy fresh, nah, so short-lived lol. Nivea Pearl and Beauty deodorant is what I would go for after Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant. I like how good it smells and how long it lasts. It&#x2019;s just very perfect. I might do a proper review of every of the other Nivea Roll ons I have used.

I find Natural Fairness roll-on all of what I want. The smell on point, longevity on point. I have had to use only Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant and nothing else on many days, nobody spray or perfume. It&#x2019;s been a good deodorant so far for me.

The lightening action can even though be seen at around 2 weeks is subtle and not significant enough to call lightening. Dark underarms is something I am trying to get rid of. I tried some natural products but I was too lazy to continue preparing the concoctions. There was no way I was going to use something for just 3 days and expect results.

I, therefore, went the easier route with Nivea deodorant. It, however, isn&#x2019;t an exactly significant result as regards to fairness. There is definitely some difference, not just significant. I also understand that body types are very different, so this might work perfectly for you in this regard.

Asides from this, I like this Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant and I might want to stick with it for longer before experimenting again.

### Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant Price

I bought this for 500 Naira in a store. Virtually all of the Nivea deodorants cost 500 Naira in stores so I just prepare for that amount for any Nivea deodorant. You could get Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant for more in online shops like Jumia or Konga. You can buy a pack of 3 Nivea Natural Fairness Deodorant bottles at 2,295 Naira at Jumia.

In conclusion, I have had a very pleasant body cream experience with Nivea Natural Fairness body lotion. Yes, I will recommend it to anybody. It will even out your body tone and bring out your natural fairness. Isn&#x2019;t that why it is called &#x201C;Natural FAIRNESS&#x201D;?
