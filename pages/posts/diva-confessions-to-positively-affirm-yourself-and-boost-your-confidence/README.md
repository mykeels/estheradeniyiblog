These **Diva confessions** are from The Diva Principle, Secrets to Divine Inspiration for Victorious Attitude by Michelle McKinney Hammond. If you missed the first excerpt from the book, you should [read it here](https://estheradeniyi.com/my-name-is-not-superwoman-self-care-habits-for-a-better-life/). It talks about how not to be a superwoman and some other important considerations about self-care.

Below, I will share some of the life-changing Diva confessions from Michelle Hammond&#x2019;s book. I am going to be writing them as text on images too so that you can share, save on your phone or use them as wallpapers.

**Diva confessions for positivity, self-love, and confidence**

1. I will celebrate myself and acknowledge that I am a specially handcrafted addition to God&#x2019;s awesome creation.

2. I will disassociate from those who feed me negativity. I will only surround myself with those who provoke and promote me to be the best I can be.

3. I will value myself, my heart, my mind, and my body. I will not discount my love or give away my pearls to those who are not discerning of their worth.

4. I will be kind to my body and nurture it to be the best that it can be. I will no longer eat out of emotion but will make wise choices and select food that will promote my health, strength, and beauty. I will be as discriminating about what I put into my body as well as what I put on it.

5. I will be diligent in my pursuit of wisdom and remain transparent in the face of truth, honestly assessing my choices and actions and making changes where necessary. I will not be too proud to receive sound counsel.

6. I will strive to be a gift to others, always seeking to enrich their lives as they enrich mine. I will not be afraid of my vulnerability but rather will see it as a powerful tool for granting favor, as well as my heart&#x2019;s desires.

7. I will recognize the source of all blessings and allow God to bless whom He chooses. In return, I will celebrate the blessings of others and allow them to increase my faith, believing I, too, can receive the desires of my heart.

8. I will walk in a trustworthy fashion at all times with those in my personal world as well as those at-large in my community. I will seek to be a haven to those who find it hard to be at rest.

9. I will keep short accounts of offenses and seek to keep my heart and lifestyle pure. I will be the sentry of my heart condition and will not fall prey to self-righteousness or comparing myself to others, I will approach each person in my life without guile or hidden motives.

&#xA0;

10. I will guard my heart and mind against all negative and unhealthy associations. I will welcome moments of solitude and make them my friend. I will take the time to silence all noises that could distract me from the still, small voice of God.
