 Timi Dakolo has come again o and this time it is MEDICINE. Timi Dakolo, the king of soul music! He is one of my favorite Nigerian musicians. I like his music, his lyrics and his musical behaviour.

I follow his wife on Instagram (by the way, these guys are so in love and it makes me go mushy) and I saw this new single. I loooooooooove the video. Hehehehe&#x2026; It is so so funny and beautiful. Timi Dakolo&#x2019;s yard people are so cooperative o. See as they cooperated and acted well.

Watch the video below. I know you will like it:
