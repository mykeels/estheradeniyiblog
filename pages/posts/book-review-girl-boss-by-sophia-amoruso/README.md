I am excited to have read the story of a no-good dropout go strong amidst difficulties. It&#x2019;s amazing how #Girlboss is fast becoming a revolution on its own. The harshness of the truth in there is revealing. The transparency, &#xA0;the down-to-earth talk.

No, #Girlboss isn&#x2019;t some distorted feminist book hoping to downplay men in order to achieve equality. It is one of the things I appreciate about the writing. &#xA0;I am able to relate to her struggles and her attempt to make something cool out of the frustration.

Her honest disgust for the term &#x2018;luck&#x2019; is a turn on. That she is an advocate of hard work, &#xA0;serious handwork is a reason to understand that she didn&#x2019;t rise because fate would have her do, &#xA0;it was because she chose to.

The gradual, steady rising of Nasty Girl is not one that should not be documented. No disappointments, &#xA0;it was documented thoroughly well. I am on high spirits. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s what I say when I am motivated again. That book is a life saver. Girl Boss is a life saver.

What I didn&#x2019;t &#xA0;like&#xA0;

I had to seive through the content and resources because some just didn&#x2019;t conform to my own value system. Note : my own value system. For example, &#xA0;the idea of &#x2018;little skin&#x2019; &#xA0;isn&#x2019;t me. &#xA0;If I would show skin, &#xA0;it would be my public body parts. My cleavage (like hers on display in the book cover), my thighs and whatever the opposite sex may find tempting isn&#x2019;t for show.

I also didn&#x2019;t expect what I found on #Girlboss Alexi Wasser &#x2018;s site, &#xA0;imboycrazy.com. That isn&#x2019;t the focus of the book, &#xA0;is it? But that was what I meant when I said I had to seive through the resources in there. Raw is great, &#xA0;only that too raw is too much.

Here are my top 9 favorite excerpts from #Girl Boss by Sophia&#xA0;

&#x201C;Many people assume that working from home is like a vacation, where you get to do what you want when you want. This was not the case for me. &#x201D;

&#x201C;While I was busy shooting, editing, and uploading my auctions, sneaky competitors trolled my listings to look for things to report. &#x201D;

&#x201C;Sophia and I learned about the business as we went along, most of which was through trial and error. &#x201D; #Girlboss &#xA0;Christina Ferrucci.

&#x201C;Figure out what you love doing and don&#x2019;t suck at, then try to figure out how to make a living doing that! Don&#x2019;t be scared. We&#x2019;re all going to die, it&#x2019;s just a question of when and how&#x2014;so be brave&#x201D; &#x2013; #Girlboss Alexi Wasser.

&#x201C;Naturally, every boyfriend comes with an ex-girlfriend, every business comes with competitors, but it is entirely up to you to decide how much time you spend thinking about them. &#x201D;

My mother told me when I was eleven years old, &#x201C;Learn how to take care of yourself so that the man you marry is the man you choose to be with and not just the man who will take care of you.&#x201D;-#Girlboss Norma Kamali

&#x201C;You can have a ton of money and buy yourself all the designer goods you can stuff into the trunk of your Mercedes-Benz, but no amount of money can buy you style. Having good style takes thought, creativity, confidence, self-awareness, even sometimes a little bit of work.&#x201D;

&#x201C;&#x201C;If you want something, you have to earnnnnn it!&#x201D; I thought it was the most annoying statement ever. Yet the older I got, the more I realized I could get a job, make my own money, and not have to ask for things. So I did. And it was so satisfying! &#x201D; -#Girlboss Ashley Glorioso

&#x201C;Paul recently reminded me of a Nasty Gal barbecue when, unpromptedhe took the hose and began to spray me with water. I grabbed the nearest thing I could&#x2014;a hamburger patty&#x2014;and threw it square at his chest, knocking the wind out of him. He was wearing a white shirt, and it left a big meat stain right on the front. So when life hits you with something unexpected, you have to be prepared to hit right back&#x2014;and leave your own smear in the process. &#x201D;
