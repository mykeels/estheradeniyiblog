Does egg make me fat? Is it okay to eat an egg or
 more a day? What about the egg yolk, must I discard to maintain my weight? Do
 hard boiled eggs make you gain weight? These have been age long questions and
 there is no assurance that we will stop asking them anytime soon. Weight loss
 enthusiasts and nutritionists seem to have a clash on this issue. This blog post
 is to help you clearly understand the pros and cons of eating eggs, whether they
 make you fat and whether they actually increase your blood cholesterol. So,
 read on and find some insight.

I grew up amongst women who bad-mouthed eggs so much
 that it was a sweet luxury for us. If at all they ate eggs, they would discard
 the egg yolk. It was therefore natural for me to walk on egg shells around
 eggs. It was in fact common to associate any woman&#x2019;s fat to her daily or almost
 daily consumption of eggs. The accused women themselves agreed and confessed
 that they couldn&#x2019;t help it; they just enjoyed eggs.

The concerns surrounding eating eggs (boiled, fried,
 as omelets,in egg rolls etc.) and their getting you fat revolves around two
 facts: they are high in cholestersol and fat. The average weight looser
 therefore assumes that avoiding eggs or eating only the whites will be the best
 bet. These worries are valid because 60% of the nutritional breakdown of eggs
 is attributed to fat.

But here is the darn truth
 about eggs and [getting fat](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/5-healthy-ways-to-gain-weight?m=1): one egg contains only 70 calories with a good
 balance of protein and fat. Protein has the incredible advantage making you
 feel fuller for a long time. People who are concerned about the weighing
 balance numbers can start off the morning with a breakfast rich in eggs. This
 will help to increase satiety and decrease hunger cravings. In fact, a study
 published by the International Journal of Obesity observed that dieters who ate
[two eggs for breakfast](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n10/abs/ijo2008130a.html)
 for five days out of the week lost 65% more weight than those who consumed a
 bagel. It was also concluded that &#x201C;the egg breakfast enhances weight loss, when
 combined with an energy-deficit diet, but does not induce weight loss in a
 free-living condition.&#x201D;

Greater news is that eating eggs do not raise your
 cholesterol levels in any significant or worrisome way. We have the dietary cholesterol
 and blood cholesterol. We are led to believe that dietary cholesterol have a
 great, significant effect on blood cholesterol but that is not exactly true. If
 anything, [eating eggs increases the levels of good cholesterol](https://examine.com/faq/will-eating-eggs-increase-my-cholesterol/).
 There&#x2019;s little, if any, relationship between dietary and blood cholesterol.

You also do not have to consume your eggs raw to
 effect weight check. Hard boiled eggs are nutritious and to your favour if you are
 watching your weight.

Concluding that eating egg yolks has no negative
 effect is safe. It is also safe to conclude that eggs do not make you fat. So you
 can eat eggs without nursing the fear of weight gain and increased cholesterol
 level. However, care must be taken as to how you prepare them because boiled
 eggs as a matter of fact are better alternatives to fried eggs.

&#xA0;An egg a morning,
 in fact is a great way to start a nutritious day so discard the idea that
 eating eggs everyday makes you fat. Enjoy your eggs.Did you find this blog post helpful? Kindly share with your friends on social media. The sharing icons are just below this blog post.
