#### &#x201C;Important Parenting Tips for Successful Child Rearing&#x201D; is a guest post by Amohuni Fred Jatto

I&#x2019;ve seen so many mothers struggle as they bring up their
 children in the best way they possibly can and still create time to take care
 of themselves and their husbands. I pause for a while and ask myself: &#x2018;What
 kind of mother would I want to be to my children when I start bearing them?&#x2019;

Parenting or child rearing is the best thing
 that can ever happen to a woman. A lady revealed that when she was in her sixth
 grade, her teacher went round the classroom and was asking the students one by
 one what they would like to become when they grew up.

Some students said
 Medical Doctors, some said Pilots, others, Engineers. The response went on
 and on. When it came to her turn, she stood up proudly and said that she wanted
 to be a full-time mother, so that she could rear her children well and become
 prominent in life.

Her teacher told her to aim a little higher. Because of the
 great achievements so many women have made in the highly competitive world
 today, being a mother and giving adequate time to rearing your children is
 being viewed as a little life achievement and a simple job.

Successful child
 rearing is the greatest achievement any woman can ever attain in life. This is
 more than being president of the most powerful nation without a child with good
 up-bringing. The joyous feeling that you&#x2019;re carrying a full human being in your
 womb, during pregnancy, is the outset of this greatness.

That&#x2019;s not the end. Being
 able to successful raise the child, after bearing, into a full-fledged man or
 woman who becomes very prominent in the world, is the great achievement that I
 am talking about. There are certain things you should watch out as you engage
 in this noble assignment, which I shall briefly highlight:

Create ample time for
 your child as he grows up 

Your child should be one of your major priorities, right from
 birth to maturity. He is second to your husband in the priority scale. He needs
 your tender care, affection and love. Therefore, be careful not to throw temper
 tantrum on him when he frustrates your efforts or the demand of daily needs,
 job and care of life get you frustrated.Because of his make-up, your child is
 highly sensitive to your actions and inactions and he doesn&#x2019;t easily forget
 those things you do or refuse to do for him without adequate explanation.
 Many hurts remain indelible in his heart. No matter how tired, frustrated and
 confused you are, when you come back from work or a day outing or have a rough
 time with your husband, make sure you don&#x2019;t tell your child off when he wants
 to talk to you.
The first act you must learn in child rearing is patience. This
 is closely followed by willingness to give your child attention any time he
 needs you. No matter how busy or tight your schedule may be, give your child
 time to interrupt you very briefly, for his comfort and exchange of
 information. Mother, remember that you are the most important person in your
 child&#x2019;s life and environment.

Therefore you are the best educator of your
 child, not his school teachers. If you frequently hurt your child, he will turn
 to his peers who will listen to him, if his father not willing to give him his
 attention too. Some of these peers who offer to give your child solace may turn
 out to influence him negatively.

No matter how tired you are always make out
 time for your child. When you&#x2019;re too tired to do so, hold him tenderly close to
 yourself embrace and explain to him how tired you are as a result of the day&#x2019;s job.
 Assure him that you&#x2019;ll attend to him when you&#x2019;ve fully rested. Remember to do
 as you&#x2019;ve promised.

Don&#x2019;t indulge your
 child

Some parents, in the name of love indulge their children.
 This usually happens to &#x2018;first child&#x2019;, because of the joy of being a parent for
 the first time. In a closely knit nuclear family, the father is expected to
 initiate child discipline, while the mother sees to the compliance of the child.In the absence of the father, due to distance, separation, job, business or trips, the mother disciplines and makes sure the child complies. All
 children need to be corrected when they err. Some children resist correction.
 Such children need appropriate and proportionate force, in form of discipline
 to bring them back to the right track.
For discipline to be effective, both
 father and mother must cooperate and jointly decide on the way they would want
 their children to be disciplined when they do wrong. When children misbehave,
 the mother is usually blamed. This means that if the father is weak in term of
 child discipline, the wife should be firm and insist on discipling the child
 when necessary. It has been reported that the best mother is the mother who is
 a firm disciplinarian and at the same time shows great love and affection to
 his child.

No child enjoys discipline. But when he is brought up in a disciplined
 home and he grows up to be a successful and highly disciplined individual in
 the society, who is well respected by all, he turns round to appreciate his
 parents who disciplined him when he was young. Part of discipline is
 appreciating and commending your child when he does well in school and he&#x2019;s
 well behaved. Treat him like a prince when he&#x2019;s celebrating an important event in
 his life. Buy gifts for him and give him some measure of freedom.

Guide him to
 choose good friends who will impact his life positively. Give him some responsibilities in the home and monitor to make sure
 he does it regularly. A pampered child, most of the time, turns out to be a
 disgrace to his family and a threat to societal peace. To succeed in child
 discipline, you must strike a balance between unabated love and proper and
 proportionate discipline.

What this simply means is that you show love and affection to your children; you should
 learn to dialogue with them, no matter their ages; treat them with proper
 respect, irrespective of your children&#x2019;s ages; expose your children to what they
 are interested in and take interest in those things too; help your children to
 properly organise their time; give them proportionate and timely discipline; maintain a stable home and be
 mentors to your children.

Be the best friend of
 your child

Be the best friend of your child. This injunction applies to both
 parents. Where the father has little or no time for the child, the mother
 should be very close to the child. Because, you as the mother is closer to your
 child, as his primary carer, be a very good friend to him. When your child
 knows that you are his best friend and are willing to listen to him anytime, he
 can tell you anything about his life.Children love talking and making observations,
 therefore, be ready and willing to listen and dialogue with them. Your child
 may be very inquisitive and sometimes ask questions you may not have answers
 to. Yet don&#x2019;t shun him. If you don&#x2019;t have answers to his questions, assure him
 that you will look for answers and get back to him. Treat you child as equal,
 yet maintaining proper respect for each other. Crack jokes with him and tell
 him stories. Read books of interest to him.
Let your child know how upset you
 will be if he does something wrong, you&#x2019;ll be amased how quickly he&#x2018;ll avoid
 doing wrong things. Lovingly correct him when he makes mistake. If you have
 more than one child, try not to show preferential treatment and love to any of
 them, not even to the best behaved. Take him to take your child for outing and
 for shopping. Get to know his friends and show them love the same way he loves
 them. Take interest in his school work and attend functions in his school as
 much as you can.

The mistake most people make, which you should avoid, is that
 they think they can boss their children around. Your child already knows that
 you have authority over him, therefore don&#x2019;t try to enforce it. As your child
 grows older, gradually release him into independence and freedom. Don&#x2019;t
 unnecessarily restrict your child&#x2019;s freedom.

Trust him and entertain no report
 about him until you have thoroughly investigated any allegation against him.
 When he hits his teen, acquaint yourself with what he&#x2019;s going through at this
 stage of his life. Empathise and support him through this phase of his
 development.

In conclusion, I&#x2019;d like to enjoin you, not to compare your
 child to other children you feel are better. Your child is uniquely different
 to every other child, therefore, joyfully accept your child the way he is.
 Don&#x2019;t shout or threaten your child.This has never helped children nor their
 parents. Speak to your child, considering his age and level of understanding.
 Carefully study your child and see what works best for him. Boost your child&#x2019;s self-confidence
 and self-esteem through positive reinforcement, commendation and praise.
 Encourage him to stand up for what he knows and believes are right. The joy of
 every parent is to see their children succeed in life and make them proud.
