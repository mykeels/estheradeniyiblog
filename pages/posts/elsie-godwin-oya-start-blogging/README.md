Popular Relationship Blogger, Elsie Godwin launches her book titled; Oya Start Blogging in Lagos, Nigeria.

The book which teaches both the young and old about
 the intricacies of blogging and how to go into it has eight chapters of
 insightful wisdom and knowledge which are timely and quite contemporary.

In her words, &#x201C;the aim of writing this book is
 to get more people blogging beyond the bounds of mere gossip. I want them to
 embrace blogging as a tool for change.&#x201D;

&#x201C;There is a great need to pass on this
 knowledge about the blogosphere especially where there are lots of heresies
 about blogging from several quarters.&#x201D;

Elsie who has won several awards globally was
 featured in the Top 20 Relationship Blogs across the globe in 2017.
