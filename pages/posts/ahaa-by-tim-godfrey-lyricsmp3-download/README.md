#### Ahaa by TIm Godfrey Lyrics

Ahaa Ahaa Ahaa
 Omenma Omenma
 You are good and you are kind

Ogwo oria ogwo oria, you are my healer divine
 Onye mbu onye ikpeazu, you are the first and the last
 Onye mbu onye ikpeazu, you are the first and the last
 Master of the universe, you are the end from the source
 Nmalite no&#x2019;gwugwu, you are beginning and end
 Nmalite no&#x2019;gwugwu, you are beginning and end
 With you nothing compare, your power none can contendCall him, He&#x2019;ll answer you
 And when you&#x2019;re fallen, He&#x2019;ll pick you up
 There&#x2019;s nothing that my God can&#x2019;t do
 He&#x2019;s able, He&#x2019;s able
