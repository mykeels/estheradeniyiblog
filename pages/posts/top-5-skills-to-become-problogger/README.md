Would you like to step up your blogging journey? Do you want
 to create a successful blog and then become a Problogger? You will likely
 answer YES to these questions but HOW?. There exists a not so wide difference
 between bloggers whose blogs you stay glued to and bloggers you
 occasionally check on. Being a skilled blogger makes it easier for an
 individual to successfully grow their blogging career/hobby and develop
 themselves.

According to Neil Patel, &#x201C;If you want to continually
 grow your blog, you need to learn to blog on a consistent basis&#x201D; . You can only become a professional blogger by consistent and continuous
 learning.

This article presents you with concise details about the
 necessary skills you should acquire to become a Professional blogger or do
 better than bloggers you admire like [Esther Adeniyi](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/), just joking.
 Blogging is becoming more of a job that requires some extra skills to compete
 and stand out well among similar other blogs.

At the end of the day, every blogger wants to be successful
 and make money/fame/expertise from their blogs but only a few of them develop their skills to become pro bloggers.

## Check the Top 5 Skills You Need To Become a Problogger
 below:

The underlined skills are not peculiar to becoming a
 full-time blogger. It&#x2019;s actually a nice recipe for a hobby blogger to easily
 and quickly stand out in the blogosphere.

### 1. Writing

Do I really need to include this? maybe YES. As a blogger,
 you must be able to write and develop awesome writing skills. It&#x2019;s not easy to
 be great at writing but writing about what you are passionate about is damn
 interesting!!

Your blogging should represent a themed conversational tone,
 easy to read and simple to understand. Blogging is not an avenue to show off
 your grammar skills but semantics are allowed.

Develop draft copies of contents you will like to publish on
 your blog, read it to yourself and share with friends for feedback. You can as
 well use Grammarly and don&#x2019;t forget to run a plagiarism check if you can afford
 it to avoid some random dudes hitting hard on your blossoming journey to
 becoming a Problogger.

### 2. Image Editing or Basic Graphic Design

You will agree with me that visuals help your content to
 rank higher in search engine result pages and social media posts. Ensure every
 article on your blog comes with a picture that gives more details about the
 content of the page or interest readers to stay glued to your website. Most
 times, great images help conceive a thousand words and get your readers
 attracted.

Basic graphic design skills assist you to crop, resize and
 add texts to images if there is a need for it. You don&#x2019;t actually need to go
 into the deeper understanding of Adobe design or photoshop tools but it really
 helps in urgent situations. Check hackr.io tutorials on image editing from the
 best tutors.

### 3. CSS/HTML Editing

CSS/HTML editing to some bloggers is like asking them for
 the impossible. However, basic understanding of how to markup and style sheets
 works helps you to tweak and fine-tune your blog each time you come across a
 blog you like to emulate. Investing your time into learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, XHTML PHP, JavaScript is a great skills sets to
 become a Problogger.

### 4. Search Engine Optimization

The success of your blogging journey depends heavily on the
 amount of traffic you get from your blogs. Search engine optimization is the
 magic behind online contents ranking or showing up on search engine result
 pages. As a blogger, delivering high-quality content is a plus to your SEO
 skills and checking out competitors from similar niches to learn about the best
 practices will help you know more about keywords and how to attract organic
 traffic. You can learn the basics of [search engine optimization online](https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-seo) from
 e-learning websites and forums.
