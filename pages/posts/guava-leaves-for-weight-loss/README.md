Rarely do I have discussions with friends without closing on the weight loss note. I am exasperated myself. So, I was on a roll with someone and as usual, we ended up talking about weight and how I never lose weight eventually and how it sucks! Then she mentioned it, **guava leaves for weight loss**.

So I became inquisitive, of course. Well, I spent the rest of the day on Google, asked a few questions from some folks who seem to have heard about using guava leaves for weight loss. Apparently it has been trending for a while and I seem to be living in a guavaless hole. **Guava leaves for weight loss reviews** have been raving too, reviews have been

Guava is one of those fruits you eat once in a year. Okay, maybe not that less frequently but until you have its tree planted close to where you live or where you work, forget it, you aren&#x2019;t going to ever remember it until there is an opportunity. I used to eat it in [Unilorin](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-check-unilorin-20172018/) then because the guava tree was close to my hostel. If you know PG / Scientific Hostel, gather round, let&#x2019;s take a selfie in the comments section.

Now, I am going to say some things here and they may not work with popular opinions and that&#x2019;s absolutely fine. See, no leaf, fruit, [slimming tea](https://estheradeniyi.com/slimming-tea-for-weight-loss/) or anything in themselves have an active ingredient of some sort to cause a weight loss magic. Nothing! In fact, over-consumption of some of the things believed to cause weight loss might actually induce weight gain.

Why? You may overconsume to the point where you shoot past your recommended daily calorific intake. This brings me to this fact &#x2013; it&#x2019;s all about calories. That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;d never lose weight if you are not sound in mathematics. Kidding, lol.

You need to be able to balance how much calories you take in and how much you expend. What these fruits and teas and leaves do is to aid, help, induce weight loss. They have ingredients and substances that help to aid digestion, regulate metabolism (increase, in many effective cases), reduce bloating etc. They may also have the ability to fill you up faster so much that you are rarely hungry soon. They could also have active ingredients that release enzymes to cause you to experience hunger pangs very less frequently.

Guava leaf tea improves your digestive system. Now, one of the reasons why we may find it difficult to lose weight, especially in the stomach area is if we are becoming too bloated as a result of indigestion, or slow digestion. What guava leaf does is that&#xA0;it helps to regulate your body metabolism. It also aids in the secretion of digestive enzymes.

Guava leaves also help to relieve stress. The tea works wonders on you when you are stressed. We all know that stress is a major contributor to weight gain, especially in the tummy.

## How to dry guava leaves for tea

I know that this might not be as necessary as you thought but after I walk you through, you will realize that it is important to know **how to dry your guava leaves for tea**. From harvesting to drying and then to preparation of the tea, you can harness all of the maximum benefits these guava leaves will prepare you for your weight loss quest.

The first step to dry your guava leaves for tea is to harvest your guava leaves. The trick is to harvest the right guava leaves at the right time. First, your guava leaves should be fresh and mature. One way to make sure of this is that they are without blemishes, spots, and discoloration of any kind. The best time to harvest these guava leaves is when the guava tree just starts to form buds. At this point or time of harvesting, the essential oils that are peculiar to guava leaves are at the highest concentration. You want to get all of the best out of your guava leaves.

After harvesting your guava leaves from the guava tree, you can then wash them with water, preferably, cold, normal temperature water. Shake the guava leaves so that the excess water can yank off. Then put the leaves on a tray, one by one, separating them well.

Note that you are washing the guava leaves with normal temperature water and are drying at a normal temperature too. Avoid the use if heat or direct sunlight so that none of the usefulness of the leaves is reduced. Every day, turn the guava leaves over to aid the drying process.

When the guava leaves are thoroughly dry, upon physical examination, put them in a large non-porous container and cover them. This is called conditioning and what it does is to evenly spread the remaining moisture in the dried guava leaves. You can read more about [drying herbs here and the other different techniques](http://extension.illinois.edu/herbs/tips.cfm).

When condensation occurs, you will see this on the walls of the container or on the lid, remove the guava leaves and put them back on the tray so that drying can be complete. You can do the conditioning again and repeat for 2 weeks thereabouts. Remove leaves that are spoilt and rotten in the process.

When leaves are completely dried, you can put them in airtight containers or nylons. It is usually advisable to keep your already dried leaves away from heat, sunlight and extreme temperatures.
