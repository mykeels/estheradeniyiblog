It is a known fact that depression is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Depression many times leads to committing suicide. Many are depressed over one thing or the other. It can be a failed exam, broken relationship. Hey! You can get out of that depressive state. Here are a few steps that can help you overcome.

Stop brooding over the matter: thoughts play a major part of our &#x201C;action process&#x201D; and when you brood over a thing or situation for too long, you will surely find yourself in that depressive mood. At times, it may not be easy to forget it but you can shut your mind from brooding over the matter. Focus on positive things. Thinking about a day gone sour will only weary your heart.

Give yourself a Pep talk: words carry power but it depends on how you make use of it. You can give yourself a positive pep talk by speaking positive words to yourself. Take for example, you just failed an exam and you feel depressed (who wouldn&#x2019;t feel like that?) you can overcome that mood by speaking words like &#x201C;I am not a failure. I have an excellent brain. I am brilliant&#x2026;&#x201D; you cannot keep speaking like this and remain in that depressive mood.

Avoid staying alone: yes! You can take a walk; think of what you love doing. Your passion keeps you from depression. If you sit alone doing nothing, there will always be tendency for you to swerve back into that mood. Listen to songs, hangout with friends, read books etc

Pray: does that look odd? Wait until you try it out.. The Holy book says &#x201C;don&#x2019;t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything; tell God your needs&#x2026;&#x201D; Phil4:6. Prayer goes a long way in easing you of burdens that causes depression. &#x201C;let him have all your worries and cares for he is always thinking about you and watching everything that concerns you&#x201D; 1Pet5:7

Stand up and get out of that state; you can dominate whatever you want to dominate. Life does not have to dominate you. You have been empowered to dominate.
