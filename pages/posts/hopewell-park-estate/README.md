## Traffic Advice

Leaving home on or before 6 AM will get you to Victoria Island in about 45 to 50 minutes, give or take a few minutes. When planning your work route, it is advised to leave before 6 am to avoid spending 3 hours or more on the road. Mondays are usually hectic and roads are very congested, so we advise you leave home a little earlier on Mondays to save some time.

Evening rush hour is very unavoidable. The traffic leaving V/I after 5pm is so hectic, you could spend about 3 or 4 hours to get to your destination.

The real estate market in Eleko (where Hopewell Park Estate is situated) is in high demand due to her proximity to the Lekki Free Trade Zone as such, purchasing a property in Eleko promises high returns.

Land appreciation rate in this area is over 50% per year.

### SPORTS FACILITIES

Residents of Hopewell Park Estate can find leisure-friendly places within the Ibeju lekki corridor for their sporting needs.

## Who Should Live Here

The neighbourhood of Eleko is fast developing due to the plan of the new Trade Zone and the new Dangote Refinery to be located there. This will make Eleko a hub of the rich and possibly the upper and middle-class Nigerians in a few years.
