**SiteGround hosting** is not the popular or first choice of [Bloggers in Nigeria](https://estheradeniyi.com/top-5-popular-bloggers-in-nigeria/) and that&#x2019;s pretty understandable because it is either we go for [Nigerian hosting companies based in Nigeria](https://www.qservers.net/) or we choose Bluehost. Bluehost seems to me as the only foreign hosting company that is readily popular around here.

## My transition into WordPress

Some months ago, [I migrated from Blogger to WordPress](https://estheradeniyi.com/why-and-how-i-migrated-from-blogger-to-wordpress/). You can click on the link to fully understand my reasons (why I migrated to WordPress), the process and how I got started on WordPress.

While I was on Blogger, I knew that I would for sure go for WordPress at a point. I loved Blogger and I was stuck on it for a very long time. Sometimes I feel very nostalgic about Blogger so much that I go check out some of my other Blogger friends on Blogger.

So, the other day, I was sharing on my [Whatsapp](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-start-blog-on-whatsapp/) status how much I loved to see spikes in my blog traffic. I shared how incredibly happy I usually am to log on to my Google Analytics to find something worth bragging about for the day or month.

The other side of the story is how quickly I remember my hosting plan and how much hosting space I have. I never had to worry about this when I was using Blogger. I was as free as air. So to speak, getting stuck on Blogger was majorly finances. I didn&#x2019;t want to worry about hosting. Security too, maybe.

When I decided to take the plunge and finally migrate to WordPress, it happened so quickly, like, in a flash. Of course, I had been brooding over it, I needed to step up my Blogging game. I wanted to make more money and be free to optimize my blog for search engines as I want.

So, I migrated after many months of brooding and stuff. I stabilized pretty quick. My blog traffic stabilized in just a month. The following month, my traffic quadrupled. Yeah, you read that right. I was on times four!

Okay, I put in a better strategy, a much more luscious blog content plan and some more informed tenacity. So, the immense blog traffic wasn&#x2019;t only limited to my migration to WordPress.

## Deciding what hosting company to sign up with

While I was deciding on what hosting company to sign up with, I remembered an article I had read on [heleneinbetween](https://heleneinbetween.com/start-profitable-blog). By the way, Helene Sula is one of my favorite foreign Bloggers. I decided to go look up the article again to make a final decision because as at the time, I was stuck in between Bluehost and Siteground.

There is a lot of **Bluehost vs SiteGround debate** on the internet right now and I think Nigerians are responsible for more than half of that discussion. Okay, kidding though. I literally don&#x2019;t know what y&#x2019;all talk about on the internet.

I finally settled for [**SiteGround**](https://www.siteground.com/recommended?referrer_id=7825658) and here I am with a **SiteGround review**. Am I happy I made the decision? Yes. Do I regret anything so far? No. Am I being paid for this review? No. Okay, that wasn&#x2019;t necessary though but I had to put that out there so that you wouldn&#x2019;t have to be scared of a bias somewhere or something.

There are, however, affiliate links in this blog post. These links are my own personal links that I have from SiteGround so that if you click on them, I have a small commission off that sale. I hope that this part of the blog post isn&#x2019;t enough to discourage you from using my own unique referral. Hopefully, it isn&#x2019;t. You don&#x2019;t pay extra in any way, I only gain extra Dollars.

## SiteGround Hosting Review

![Siteground hosting company](images\Siteground-hosting-company.png)

So far, [using SiteGround has been awesome](https://www.siteground.com/recommended?referrer_id=7825658). I had to take Helene&#x2019;s word which was, by the way, risky. I had never used any other hosting company for my own personal blog so using a hosting company based on some other foreign Blogger&#x2019;s review wasn&#x2019;t totally safe.

Here, I am, in Nigeria, where things can be somewhat different. One thing I knew I didn&#x2019;t want to do was go for a Nigerian hosting company. Please, don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I am not categorically saying that no Nigerian hosting is good. In fact, I have heard of a few of them with good uptime, excellent pricing, and superb customer service. I just haven&#x2019;t used them for myself or any of my clients.

The issue here is of that all of the people I personally know as Bloggers using Nigerian hosting have complained. In fact, a whole bunch of them have lost their blogging vibe because of the many troubles they have faced with their hosts.

### Interesting/fun facts about SiteGround

- SiteGround was founded by a group of University Students
- It is listed as one of WordPress supported hosting sites
- SiteGround was founded in 2004 and has ever since then grown to become very reputable in the internet hosting space

## Why I love SiteGround Hosting/ Advantages of using SiteGround

- **100% Uptime**

Uptime is one of the most important factors to consider in choosing a hosting company. SIteGround&#x2019;s servers have had 100% uptime scores so far. One of the things webmasters have to avoid like a plague is having to frequently experience lack of accessibility of a site. It is frustrating to you as the owner, it is frustrating to your blog reader too.

- **Excellent Customer Support**

So I have mentioned this [a couple of times in different places on the blog](https://estheradeniyi.com/buy-a-domain-name/) and this is partly due to the treatment I have received from companies in the past. If they don&#x2019;t ignore you, they are rude. I literally can&#x2019;t deal with poor customer service.

SiteGround is one of the best professional and reliable companies I have worked with so far and even though this is not an active Hosting assessment factor, it is to me. The internet can be very dicey and tricky. I, therefore, want to be able to ask for help and get it immediately and with premium quality.

I can&#x2019;t count how many times I have logged on to my **siteGround cpanel** to get on to **SiteGround live chat**. Every time, I have been able to get my problems solved and immediately too.

- **Custom service specifically for WordPress Users**

SiteGround offers hosting options for so many other web platforms asides WordPress. So, it isn&#x2019;t limited to only WordPress. Interesting thing is that they have a lot of easy WordPress plug and play services, including installation.

For example, I didn&#x2019;t have to install my WordPress.org software manually. In just one click I was WordPress ready. This is why using them, especially as a new Blogger is very easy.

- **Free Website Transfer Services**

Apparently, not everyone is tech oriented and I find this to be an extension of their excellent customer support. If you are hoping to transfer your website from one hosting to theirs, it&#x2019;s as easy as using the website transfer option. I would advise that you chat them up on their SiteGround live chat first to notify them so that they can walk you through seamlessly.

- **Affordable pricing&#xA0;**

SiteGround has a very affordable pricing compared to a lot of other hosting companies. Below is a screenshot of [SiteGround pricing and packages.](https://www.siteground.com/web-hosting.htm)

![SIteground pricing](images\SIteground-pricing.png)

In conclusion, having to host my blog on SiteGround has been really cool. I have also taken the time to read other SiteGround reviews 2018, they have been mostly positive.
