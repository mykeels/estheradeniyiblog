If they said **Domino&#x2019;s Pizza** would be in Abeokuta,&#xA0; Ogun state, in 2018, I bet you would express utter disbelief. This was what happened when [Shoprite showed up in Ota, Ogun state](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/shoprite-opens-in-ogun-state?m=1). Y&#x2019;all were vexed it wasn&#x2019;t in Abeokuta, I can remember vividly.

Do you know that till now, when I check my blog&#x2019;s analytics, I still see searchers searching for &#x201C;Shoprite in Abeokuta&#x201D; and I am like, seriously! Sorry to burst your bubble o, it&#x2019;s in Ota. Thank you.

Abeokuta, Ogun state&#x2019;s capital, recently, has been taking new shapes and looks.
