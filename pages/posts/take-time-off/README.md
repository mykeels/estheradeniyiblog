[Combining blogging with a full time job](https://estheradeniyi.com/combine-blogging-with-full-time-job/) is the most super hero thing to do. It&#x2019;s okay if your blog is just a hobby blog. You can cheat here, be lazy there and have zero expectations from your blog. Inasmuch as I like to share blogging tips from a place of authority, I would like to be vulnerable and delicate in this one post.

Last week, on my way home, I felt unloved. I had not looked at myself in a while. I felt unloved by me. I had been so rigid, so strict, sometimes, unkind to myself. I didn&#x2019;t allow myself rest. During the week, (people who read my whatsapp status can testify to this), I had complained about needing a massage. I felt so stiff and out of touch. I was touching burnout base on all fronts.

This weekend, I tried to do some self diagnoses. What was going on? I seemed to be living a robotic life and this stemmed from too much of expectations. I needed to write, I needed to thoroughly satisfy my boss(es), I wanted to make more money, I wanted to still be connected to God in the midst of this chaos.

After self diagnosing, I was able to point out three prominent problems and make clear resolutions to solve them.

## 1. I will worry less about tasks and actually do them

When seemingly impossible tasks creep into my work life, I spend a lot of time worrying about accomplishing them so much that I lose the joy of enjoying the process and actually doing the task.

I needed to do something at work the other day. This is one of such tasks I have never done before. It also is, realistically speaking, a seemingly impossible target to meet. So, I spent all of my work and off work hours worrying about how I was ever going to pull it off.

I was worried about coming off as incompetent, I was angry that I had to do something that would stretch me so thin and I was unsure of where to start from. I finished a portion of the task, which is no where 20% and began my weekend (Friday evening) worrying about how to complete it on Monday.

I knew that the whole of the weekend was going to be worry weekend and that made me feel very frustrated. In a flash, I had a brain twist on the issue and I virtually took the uncompleted task off my head and let it rest on my work desk, where it really should be.

*&#x201C;Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.&#x201D; Matt 6:34 (NIV)&#xA0;*

## 2. I will say no, more frequently, maybe everytime

I have been known to take up volunteer projects, barely paid jobs and free, unproductive tasks. This weekend I resolved to say no to them more frequently. When I assess these projects and see that they have little or no impact in getting me to where I really want to be in life, I will say no to them, very boldly.

Amidst the much work I had on my plate was a volunteer project I took up. I really thought I needed to do very little until demands began to fill my head. Here I was worrying about work and delivering clients&#x2019; jobs. I also had to worry about this volunteer job?

As I write this, I have resolved to pull out of it so that I can have more space in my head to think about other important or paid projects I have to deliver. I have also resolved that henceforth, I will never jump into any project or task anyhow. I will also be careful about taking up blogging clients. If I see that a client is going to be a waste of my time and resources, they won&#x2019;t happen.

## 3. I will take time off everything and not feel guilty about it

Last night, at the brink of making these resolutions, my friend chatted and asked if I wanted to hang out. Now, let me break this down for you. I rarely hang out. I rarely do anything that doesn&#x2019;t involve me reading up on [Search Engine Optimization](https://estheradeniyi.com/best-seo-tips-for-bloggers/), managing and maintaining my blog or a client&#x2019;s, social &#x2018;mediaing&#x2019;, name other work related kinda stuff.

I said that I rarely which means that I do sometimes. But when I do, I worry about tasks I left behind, I worry about things I left undone, I worry about how much time I have wasted by enjoying myself and being kind to myself.

Last night was different. I was working on that tech volunteer project but as soon as I saw that chat, I shut down my system, [dressed up in under 15 minutes and zoomed out](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-get-up-get-dressed-and-get-ou/). I was at my friend&#x2019;s place in 30 minutes.

On my way to his place I began to work on myself. I first of all shut every feeling of guilt, positioned myself to enjoy his and his friend&#x2019;s company and switch off my phone. We&#x2019;re all gon have fun man.&#xA0; Truth is, I didn&#x2019;t end up switching off the phone. I guess this is all a process. I will learn to enjoy without guilt gradually.

I am happy that I am going to watch a movie by the end of today and start on a very interesting book I got from a friend. I am also going to cook something light for myself and do myself the honor of being kind to her. Today, I am taking time off worry, work stuff and stressful volunteer projects.

Let me know if this resonates with you and how it does?
