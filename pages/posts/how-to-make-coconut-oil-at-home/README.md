If you knew **how to make coconut oil at home**, would you? I mean, the rate at which we have adulterated coconut oil in carefully bottled containers is just saddening.

Worse off is that they tell you it&#x2019;s **virgin coconut oil** and because you don&#x2019;t know how to differentiate between the original and fake coconut oil, you just take the seller by their word.

Did you know that the so-called pure organic coconut oil brands are not necessarily virgin coconut oil? Like, you see them bottled up with the almighty inscription &#x2013;**100% pure, virgin coconut oil.**

Who are you to question though, you practically don&#x2019;t know how to make coconut oil anyway. Well, this is going to change now, right away. You&#x2019;d be surprised at how easy it is to make coconut oil in the comfort of your home.

With a bowl, small hammer, fridge, was water and the actual coconut, you are good to go. Somehow you can finally vouch for 100% coconut oil.

The process might be a little bit stressful but trust me, the **pure coconut oil** you get at the end of the day is worth the stress.

What&#x2019;s the fuss about coconut oil though? Well, [its benefits are just amazing.](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1092/coconut-oil) Coconut oil, like shea butter is used for a lot of things.

I grew up to get familiar with organic products with coconut oil and shea butter. These two have never stopped being talked about ever since and it seems like the more time we spend using them, the better we understand and discover so much more about them.

By the way, I have made a [very good post on shea butter here](https://estheradeniyi.com/shea-butter/). It is amazingly detailed with benefits, uses, how it&#x2019;s made and even some of its side effects.

## How to prepare homemade coconut oil

![how to prepare coconut oil at home](images\coconut-oil-1-1.png)

### Prepare your coconut

Break the coconut with a small hammer or any other object. Some people like to smash it on the floor.

This is also fine provided everyone is safe and your popsi isn&#x2019;t pressing charges on a damaged floor anytime soon. Do that outdoors anyway!

With a small knife, pull out the coconut from its inner shell. Usually, this is always easy if the coconut is ripe.

As soon as you make the first series of attempts to pull the coconut meat out, the remainder of the coconut should come off easily.

Further break your coconut pieces with your hammer and rinse well.

### Grind your coconut, in batches

In batches, pour your coconut pieces into your blender and add warm water.

Warm water will make blending very easy. Hopefully, you are using a strong blender too.

Separate coconut milk from the chaff. You can use your **coconut milk** for a lot of things. If you would like to learn how to use your coconut milk to make [Nigerian coconut rice, click here.](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-prepare-nigerian-coconut-rice/)

Pour your ground coconut into a tiny pore sieve. You can use the clothes people use to sieve and make fine flour. You can also use a clean white cloth.

When you pour your ground coconut into the sieve, squeeze to drain out the milk from the coconut chaff.

You can grind the chaff again to extract more coconut milk from it and repeat the process of straining it out.

### Extracting the coconut oil from the coconut milk

Pour your coconut milk into a bowl and keep inside your fridge. This should be for 12 or more hours. You can do this overnight.

When you check, the coconut oil would have separated and risen to the top. It should form a caked layer

Remove the caked coconut oil and put in a pot for cooking at medium heat while stirring.

You are done when you begin to notice some charred coconut parts in your coconut oil.

Leave the pot to cool at room temperature

With a clean, white chiffon material, you can sieve out the charred portion of your coconut oil so that you have clean, virgin coconut oil.

**Voila! Your pure, original, unadulterated coconut oil is ready.**

Now that you know how to make coconut oil at home, are you going to prepare homemade coconut oil anytime soon?
