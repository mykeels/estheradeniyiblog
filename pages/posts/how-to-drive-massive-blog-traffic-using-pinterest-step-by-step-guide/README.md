If you are not already **using Pinterest to drive traffic to your blog**, you are leaving a lot on the table and I think it is a tad unfair to your blogging self. Here you are, writing posts, sharing them and doing everything you can to get blog visibility, the only thing missing is Pinterest.

Even if you are planning to generate traffic from search engines, it might take a while depending on the competition and the strategy that you have decided to go with. This means that you have to wait until Google realizes that you are serious and are capable of providing some awesome value online.

The waiting period for Google and other people to finally catch on might be trying. Sharing on Whatsapp and Facebook might not bring you as much mileage as you may want, especially if you don&#x2019;t have enough audience on these channels.

It is like setting yourself up to be frustrated and exhausted, Maybe, if you are not doing awesome things on your blog but if you are killing yourself, little or no traffic is going to discourage you

If you are ready to do something about this, I am ready, and together, we can strap up and get the best out of that amazing platform.

With Pinterest, you can begin to rake in immediate traffic all with the right approach and best strategy. My article on [how I get more than 100,000 page views every month](https://estheradeniyi.com/100k-blog-traffic-every-month-on-my-blog/) might be all that you need to convince you.

What I am going to do is take you through, in detailed steps, how to get started on Pinterest, how to optimize your Pinterest account and boards and everything else you need to begin to drive some serious traffic to your blog.

### What is Pinterest?

![what is Pinterest, Esther Adeniyi on Pinterest, Nigerian Bloggers on Pinterest, estheradeniyisblog](images\What-is-Pinterest.png)

Pinterest is a platform where people share ideas using pins. These pins are saved to boards that contain similar pins on the same topic. Even though people refer to Pinterest as a social media platform, it is in reality, a search engine.

A lot of people go to Pinterest to search for recipes, fashion ideas, DIY ideas on different crafts, makeup inspiration, self-help articles, mention it, just about anything. Some of these pins link to blog posts or online stores where people can read actual blog posts or place an order to buy stuff.

### Common Pinterest terminologies

A lot of people seem to be very confused about the terms used on Pinterest and this is because it is not like the other social media platforms. I will explain the most common and popular terms that Pinterest users use every day so that you are never confused anymore.

PIN: It is an image shared on Pinterest; it most often than not leads to a website, video or application source.
 BOARD: This is a collection of similar pins under the same topic.
 PINNING: The act of posting/saving a pin to a board.
 REPIN: The act of reposting a pin that has been shared on Pinterest by another user to another account. It is sometimes referred to as &#x201C;save&#x201D;
 PINNER: Anyone using the Pinterest platform

Getting started on Pinterest is very easy. In fact, in 20 minutes, you can be done with the initial set up of your Pinterest account. Whether you want to optimize and prepare your account to work for you is now left to you.

I will show you how to open the best type of account and how to set it up in just a few steps.

### Create your account

![How to create a Pinterest business account, Pinterest home page, pinterest account set up directions and guidelines, Esther Adeniyi](images\Pinterest-business-account-home-page.png)

Go to [pinterest](https://business.pinterest.com/en) to create your free business account. You are supposed to open a business account because it allows you to do a lot of things that a personal account won&#x2019;t allow you to.

For instance, with a business Pinterest account, you can view your analytics, check what boards and pins and performing well and make informed decisions as a result. With a business account, you can build a very realistic strategy going forward.

If you have always had a Pinterest account, chances are that it is a personal account, so what you want to do is upgrade the account and this is very free, no extra costs.

When you open the business sign up page for Pinterest, you create your login details.

There are different methods of sign up for Pinterest but if you ask me, I would suggest that you use an actual email address and a password.

These days it is very easy to simply open accounts with Facebook synchronization but I must let you know that it might not be the best option because anything can happen to your Facebook account.

In fact, my first Pinterest account was with Facebook. That was years ago but when I was indeed ready to take Pinterest seriously, I opened another one and this time, with my email address and an actual password.

So, on the Pinterest business account sign up page, click on &#x201C;sign up&#x201D;

![Pinterest sign up page, Esther Adeniyi](images\Pinterest-sign-up-page-1.png)

Insert your email address and password you want to use and then click on &#x201C;create account&#x201D;

To effectively explain this process, I use Nigerian Gospel Songs as an example. I am going to start this account from scratch and take you through how I intend to do it.

### Start the registration process

**1.****Pick your language and country**

![Esther Adeniyi, Pinterest registration](images\Registration-step-1.png)

**2. Choose your business profile name**

![Registration step 2, Pinterest set up, Esther Adeniyi](images\Registration-step-2.png)

For this, you can pick &#x201C;media&#x201D; or &#x201C;brand&#x201D;. If the site is a store you should pick &#x201C;online marketplace&#x201D;. If it is a business with a physical location or store, you can pick &#x201C;local business&#x201D;.

**3. Link to your website**

![Pinterest regstration step 3](images\Registration-step-3.png)

Simply type in your site address.

**4. Connect your other accounts**

![Registration step 4](images\Registration-step-4.png)

If you would like to connect other social media accounts, simple click to claim any of them, Instagram, Etsy or YouTube. If you didn&#x2019;t know, you can actually use Pinterest to build all of these social accounts.

If you are not ready to do that just yet, simply click on &#x201C;later&#x201D;

**5. Pinterest Ads**

![Registration step 5](images\Registration-step-5.png)

I suggest that you pick, &#x201C;yes, I am interested in advertising&#x201D;. In the least, you can pick &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure yet&#x201D;. The former is, however, better because you will need some of the analytical tools of the Pinterest advertising segment to do some optimizations in the future.

**6/7. Choose topics related to your business**

![Registration step 6](images\Registration-step-6.png)

The topics that you pick here are very important as they will influence your Pinterest feed. When pins are curated for you on your homepage, you want these pins to be very relevant to you and your business so that pinning is easy and so that you find the platform appealing.

**8.&#xA0; Get your Pinterest browser button**

![Registration step 8](images\Registration-step-7.png)

This is a Pinterest save button that automatically takes you to the web store when you click on &#x201C;get it now&#x201D;. This is a button that is added as an extension to your browser so that you can save images from any website in just a click on two.

### Automatically create first pins

![create first pins](images\Create-pins.png)

If your blog is brand new, you will have to find an image to add as a pin. Simply pick any image from your laptop and then add to your account and make the url to link to your blog&#x2019;s homepage. If you already have articles on the blog with pictures, images are going to be generated for you.

Just click on any of the images, create the pin and save it to your first board. You can name your first board, &#x201C;best of &#x2026;&#x201D; since these are images from your blog. E.g &#x201C;best of Nigerian Gospel Songs&#x201D;. This particular board is the board where you pin images right from your site. They should be images from your blog.

Sometimes, Pinterest will automatically create your first board for you with your website address.

Your Pinterest account is set!

![Pinterest account](images\Pinterest-account.png)

Now, it is time to begin to put things in place and optimize your overall account for maximum impact.

## Optimize your Pinterest account

Well, now you can add a good profile picture and a better Pinterest account name. Before you do all of this, you can request a feature from Pinterest. On the top right corner of your Pinterest page, you will find three dots, click on it to find that option.

This allows Pinterest to recommend you to other Pinterest users. There is no guarantee that they will do this for you but it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to try.

### Optimize your Pinterest account

Now, you want to make sure that you are seen even while you are not pushing your account and the only way to make sure this can happen is to add keywords to your profile name and profile description. To go back to edit these, click on the three dots and click on &#x201C;settings&#x201D;.

What is your blog about? What keywords do you want to show up for? Beside your profile name, write two or three of these keywords. In the description too, write them in there. This is just like you do your on-site SEO.

See how I did mine below:

![Esther Adeniyi&apos;s Pinterest profile](images\Esther-Adeniyis-profile.png)

### Create your boards and optimize them

Now, begin to create your boards and optimize them with keywords too. To create boards, you can check accounts that are similar to yours and see what boards they have. This will give you an idea of what kind of boards you should be creating.

### Create your first set of pins

I have an article on [how to create viral pins](https://estheradeniyi.com/viral-pin-how-to-create-your-first-viral-pin-on-pinterest/). Please check it out so that you can begin to create pins that are viral worthy.

## Claim your blog on Pinterest

While you are now creating boards and pinning, you should get on with claiming your blog on Pinterest.

Claiming your blog can only be done on the Pinterest business account. This is why I recommended that in the first place. Claiming your blog on Pinterest will give you access to analytics pertaining to your blog.

With a claimed site, your profile picture will show up as a thumbnail beside the pins that are pinned from articles on your site. To also confirm that your site has been claimed, a globe icon will show up next to your URL on your profile.

See the difference between an account that has been claimed and one that has not.
![claimed blog on pinterest](images\CLAIMED-ACCOUNT.png)Claimed blog on Pinterest![unclaimed blog on pinterest, life for rent](images\unclaimed-blog-on-pn.png)Unclaimed Blog on Pinterest
There are two ways by which you can claim your site on Pinterest. You can use the meta tag option or upload an HTML file to your site&#x2019;s HTML code.

These are really easy so you do not have to worry about all of these languages. Just follow through step by step.

### Claim your site using the meta tag option

Preferably, do this on your laptop. This way it will be easier.

-Go to Pinterest and click on those three dots at the right-hand corner of your page (as usual, lol)

-Select settings. Then click on &#x201C;claim.&#x201D;

-Enter your URL and click on &#x201C;claim&#x201D;

&#x2013; You will find two options, click on the &#x201C;add HTML tag&#x201D; option.

&#x2013; Copy the tag and click on &#x201C;Next&#x201D;

&#x2013; Go to the <head> section before the <body> section, in the index.html file of your website and add the tag.

&#x2013; Go back to Pinterest and click &#x201C;Submit&#x201D;, then click &#x201C;done&#x201D;.

### Claim your blog using the HTML file upload option

When you get to the options, the tag or upload, click on the &#x2018;upload HTML file option&#x2019; instead.

&#x2013; Click &#x201C;Download&#x201D; then click &#x201C;Next&#x201D;

&#x2013; Upload the HTML file to your web server at the root folder.

&#x2013; Go back to Pinterest and click &#x201C;Submit&#x201D;

&#x2013; Click &#x201C;Done&#x201D;

After you click &#x201C;Submit&#x201D;, Pinterest will automatically check for these tags and automatically claim your blog.

From experience, I would advise that you go for the first option. In fact, the first option is the only option that works for Bloggers using Blogspot.

## Apply for rich pins

Next, you should apply for rich pins. Rich pins are very optional but they are very good because they help to draw up descriptions under your pins. They necessarily make your pins rich.

If it&#x2019;s a recipe, you will see a few, necessary excerpts alongside your pin. You will also notice that your titles under the pins are bolder and more visible.

With rich pins, more people will click on your pins to visit your blog because it is more dominant and visible.

**This is a rich pin**

![rich pin](images\Rich-pin.png)

You see that this rich pin has:

- an emboldened title
- a follow button
- description
- published date

**This is a pin that is not rich**

![not a rich pin](images\not-a-rich-pin.png)

Of course, the former is better. Anyone would click on a rich pin.

### Types of pins

There are four types of Rich Pins:

*Product Pins* include price details, availability, and where to buy.

*Recipe Pins* include ingredients, cooking times, and serving sizes.

*App Pins* include install button for people to directly download your app.

*Article Rich Pins* include bold title, author and little description show.

So, how do you apply for this, very easy. I must also mention that Blogspot bloggers find it very difficult to apply, so this tutorial only covers for WordPress Bloggers. I will release a separate article on how to apply for rich pins on Blogger if you request for it.

Also, this process is for article rich pin application. I will write on the rest if you are interested. You can just let me know in the comments section.

*Step 1*: Go to Yoast SEO Plugin.

If you do not have Yoast plugin, this is where you stop to install and activate.

Click on settings and go to the&#xA0;Social&#xA0;tab in&#xA0;its settings.

Click on the Facebook tab and make sure the Open Graph metadata is ON.&#xA0; Pinterest and other social platforms use your Facebook metadata

Check to see if &#x201C;Add Open Graph metadata&#x201D; is &#x201C;Enabled&#x201C;. It should be.

*Step 2*: Validate Your Rich Pins

Click on thIS [Rich Pin Validator link](https://developers.pinterest.com/tools/url-debugger/) and insert any URL from your site. Then click the &#x201C;Validate&#x201D; button.

*Step 3*: Click Apply for Rich Pins

Click on &#x201C;apply for rich pins&#x201D;. You should get a green check and &#x201C;Your rich pins are approved and on Pinterest&#x201D; message.

Wait for some hours, or these days, minutes, your pins should be automatically converted into rich pins. It may take longer, in which case they might (or not) send a message about the delay.

## How to drive massive blog traffic using Pinterest
