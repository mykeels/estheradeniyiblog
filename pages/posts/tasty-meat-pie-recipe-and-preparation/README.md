N:B

1. &#xA0;If you are using a local oven, &#xA0;make sure heat is set your oven at least 10 minutes before you bake your meat pie.
 2. If you are using an electric oven, &#xA0;make sure heat is set in your oven at least 7-5 minutes.
 3. Whatever name you call your pie depends on the filling you are using. For example if you are using chicken or turkey or fish, &#xA0;then it&#x2019;s either chicken pie, &#xA0;turkey pie and fish pie.
 4. If you are frying instead of baking meat pie, &#xA0;add some amount of sugar to the dough while mixing.
