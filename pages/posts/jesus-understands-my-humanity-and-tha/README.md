[![Women devotional, Esther Adeniyi](images/EstherAdeniyi.jpg)](images/EstherAdeniyi.jpg)That&#x2019;s the way my women devotional looks
Today&#x2019;s post was a lesson from my Quiet Time yesterday. I don&#x2019;t want to miss sharing this with you guys. By the way, I use the Good News Women&#x2019;s Devotional and Study Bible. I have been using it for more than a year now.

Text was Matthew 26:38-45 and below is an excerpt from the devotional. It not only lifted me and encouraged me but boosted my spiritual esteem:

&#x201C;The disciples were tired. It had been a long day. When Jesus returned each time they were asleep. I am reminded how difficult it seems to &#x2018;watch and pray&#x2019; at times. Distractions come thick and fast accompanied by many excuses. How sad that these special friends were not able to be awake and praying when he returned the final time ; within the hour he would be betrayed.

I take comfort in the fact that Jesus understands my ongoing failures to &#x2018;watch and pray&#x2019;, and I am encouraged that he will strengthen me to persevere because I love him&#x2026;and he loves me.&#x201D;

There are many times that I feel so inadequate and unworthy of being loved but this text is a reassurance of God&#x2019;s understanding of my humanity. The disciples were so tired, I can be tired too.

While I trust in God&#x2019;s capacity to help me persevere in the place of devotion and spiritual fervency, I rest in the knowledge of God&#x2019;s relation with my humanity.

How do you feel when you falter in the place of devotion and God&#x2019;s service? Do you still feel that way?
