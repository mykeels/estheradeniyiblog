&#x2018;But you are a pretty good writer&#x2019;

This is the best compliment a writer can ever get from a
 first time reader. You should experience it firsthand if you don&#x2019;t believe me
 and so, dear Fola, if you are reading this, I want you to know that that
 sentence was magic in itself and my blog entry this day is proof enough that I
 pulled through my blogging burnout. Thank you.

Just before I hit &#x2018;publish&#x2019; on my last post, I checked my
 stats and since I thought to myself that Google would have already computed my
 finalized earnings for the month, I went on ahead to check that too. I did
 check, hissed and hit &#x2018;publish&#x2019;, signed out of blogger (first time in two
 years) and decided to take an indefinite break from blogging. You can judge me
 all you want but, here, listen:

It isn&#x2019;t fair. I have to write, edit and publish articles
 all by myself. And promote too! Seriously? I know that you are thinking, &#x2018;it&#x2019;s
 your passion and nobody is forcing you&#x2019;. Yeah yeah, but I probably wouldn&#x2019;t
 have been burned out if I had an automatic traffic driver. I still wish
 somewhere deep down that there was some app like that. Of what use is it to
 write quality articles and have no one to read?

My Google Adsense earnings (after 3 years of blogging) is
 $8.37. That program is overrated abeg.
 This is for those who are asking me to invest in their businesses (from my blog
 earnings!). I hope this is proof enough that I earn little bits and invest big
 bits on this blog? One particular idi*t said that I wanted to use him to make
 money. Why? I asked him to check out an article of mine as regards our
 discussion. I honestly thought that the article was perfect enough to buttress
 our discussion and he thought his own single click was the traffic I ever
 needed. Damn!

![HOW TO AVOID BLOGGING BURNOUT](images\HOW-TO-AVOID-BLOGGING-BURNOUT.png)

My Facebook page promotion was a total waste. I was
 spending money promoting my page with little results. Yes, I earned more page
 fans but the saying that engagement is important was what I found true after
 noticing a dwindling post reach. I still have to work hard to keep my fans? On
 Facebook? For my Blog? Argggggrrrrrrhhh, that is definitely too much work.

Okies, enough of the whining and complaining, let&#x2019;s see
 how we can avoid this in future. I am putting this out here in case you are
 thinking of going down the lane I went for a whole week. I must admit that that
 was not my first or even second but I want this to be my last and I don&#x2019;t want
 you to experience it at all. If you have however ever experienced a burnout or
 are experiencing it as we speak, I want it to be your last because I am
 assuming that after reading from my experience and lessons, there will be a turnaround
 for you.

Blog
 your passion

Well, this for other bloggers because I blog my passion.
 One factor that makes you overwhelmed in any field you are in is- not doing
 what you like doing. If blogging or writing is not your thing, don&#x2019;t force it,
 you will burnout. If blogging is your thing, stay in a niche you know you can
 never ever get stuck. Of course, the writer&#x2019;s block might surface once in a
 while but it will not be an issue you will have to deal with every now and
 then.

Reduce
 the pressure

&#xA0;I mounted on
 myself too much of pressure, too much than I could handle. Here&#x2019;s how to
 relieve yourself of the pressure:

-Create a Schedule

You may have to not blog daily. Unless you are a full
 time blogger, chances are that blogging daily may be heavy. Creating a
 schedule, setting blog frequency and adjusting things to suit your job or
 schooling or parenting or whatever will [help you blog consistently.](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/5-important-tips-to-blogging) You may have to
 re-schedue over and over but it&#x2019;s okay. God knows how many times I have done
 that in here and to say the truth, my loyal readers understand me perfectly.
 Don&#x2019;t be tempted to blog out of schedule because you have an influx of articles
 and ideas turning in, you could write them, save them and push them to the backup
 articles folder. Consistency is important. I have a folder in my blog articles
 folder titled 911! Oh yeah, you should
 too. This is for the block days.

&#x2013;Take a break

This isn&#x2019;t that indefinite break, it is a plan- a plan to
 recharge the batteries and refuel the tank. Getting away from the blog hustle
 can help you find more inspiration. For one, you miss your blog and you are
 coming back with a new strategy. Even though my break was indefinite and as a
 result of a burn out, I am coming back with a new strategy. One, I am sticking
 with my most recent blogging schedule. Two, I am drastically reducing my usage
 of local languages. My Google analytics revealed a big lot to me; for crying
 out loud, I have visitors from Russia even.

&#x2013;Ask for help

What about asking someone to guest write on your blog?
 You could even get a co-writer who has the same passion as you have about your
 niche. If you do not like blog partnerships, you can stay with a guest writer.
 I, personally, do not like partnering with people on the blog because of the
 disadvantages, they far outweigh the advantages. I could make a post of this
 someday.

&#x2013;Walk in purpose&#xA0;

Thinking about why you started your blog will help you refocus and reduce the weight of trying to do more than you are supposed to be doing. I didn&#x2019;t start blogging because I needed to be rich; I started because I wanted to express and inform people at the same time. I wanted to share my journey through life with people outside my home. So&#x2026;

Stop
 obsessing over stats

I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get to this point. For starters, this
 is kill- joy. I will advise that you check in once a week. People with lots of traffic
 rarely obsess over stats. A drop is horror but they don&#x2019;t obsess. If you are
 not expecting what you see every time you check it has a way of taking something
 away from you. You remember Bonny in Vampire diaries? Laughing&#x2026;Okay was that
 the perfect example? Whatever, you get the point.

Never
 ever, ever ever, ever compare

Don&#x2019;t do it! Never give in to the temptation to compare
 yourself with other bloggers. They did something to get to that height they are
 in too. It wasn&#x2019;t magic; they worked hard. You must believe that every
 successful blogger worked hard; there is no luck in this, maybe some grace but
 no luck. Instead of comparing yourself, take a moment to reevaluate, work hard
 and find peace within yourself. Try to remind yourself of your purpose for
 blogging and why you stuck with it all this while. And all that thinking you
 are not good enough is a lie. If you weren&#x2019;t you would not be blogging in the
 first place, trust me.

So, this is where I sign off. Blog your passion, reduce
 the pressure, stop obsessing over stats, never compare and avoid that blogging burnout.
 Have a fabulous week ahead of you. Love you.

P.S- Please share this article if you find it worth it.
 Thank you.
