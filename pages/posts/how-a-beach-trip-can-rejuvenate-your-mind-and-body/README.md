The moment you think about vacation there are mostly two things that come to your mind- Hill stations or sea beaches. Hill stations may be beautiful but they are more on the hectic side and a total no-no for the lazy people who&#x2019;d rather just rest than hike around. Especially for the people who rarely get holidays and prefer to rest and relax rather than walking and traveling nonstop.

For those who prefer sea to mountains, there is a piece of good news for you! Going to a beach is an ideal holiday idea since going to the beach provides you a lot of benefits both inside and outside. And the scenic beauty is a total plus point!

**Reduces Stress and Anxiety**

Your mind is constantly subjected to stress due to working throughout the day for many days in a row and it needs to unwind every now and then. Beach vacations are your best friend if you need proper relaxation to reduce your stress from everyday life. The sound of the sea waves is scientifically proven to reduce stress and anxiety. The air is refreshing and helps calm the mind.

The relaxing effect is brought about by the combined effect of the wind, sun, and the sound of the sea. [Serotonin, the hormone responsible for relaxation](https://blog.daftmobile.com/short-story-about-the-brain-chemicals-and-how-they-affect-players-d078792139ec), is released as soon as you hit the beach. The sound and scene of the beach will surely relax your mind and make you calm.

**Gives You Peace Of Mind**

Heading to the beach will heal you mentally as well as spiritually and enhance your consciousness. You feel like appreciating every aspect of life just like you appreciate your surroundings. You feel a certain oneness with yourself and nature, even if you are not a very spiritual person.

Yoga feels much better when done at the beach due to its better air quality and beautiful horizons. Your mind calms down significantly which affects your overall health in a positive way.

**Helps You Get Your Beauty Sleep**

If you are by any chance suffering from sleep-related problems then going to the beach could solve it. Just a few hours at the beach can guarantee you a wonderful good night&#x2019;s sleep. The reason you doze off to your bed after a few hours at the beach is that the key factors that cause insomnia- stress, anxiety and lack of physical activity, are relieved by the beach.

As we read above, the beach relieves us of stress and anxiety and going to the beach always includes some kind of physical activity. Therefore for insomnia sufferers, a beach would be a good natural remedy.

**Heals you**

The unique antibacterial and antifungal properties of seawater may help you with your external infections. The pain caused in the open wounds when exposed to seawater is actually a sign that the water is cleansing it. Seawater helps in the healing process of both external and internal wounds.

Iodine found in seawater boosts up our immune system and also has many other benefits such as maintaining energy levels and metabolic rates, increased hair and nail growth, regulation of hormone levels, and so on. Iodine is also highly antiseptic and used in surgeries and all.

It also helps maintain the function of our thyroid gland thereby boosting our immune system. The sun rays also provide us with [vitamin D which is very helpful for our skin](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/benefits-vitamin-d) and bones.

**Keeps You Fit**

If you are looking for ways to lose weight during the vacation but also have some fun doing that, a beach trip will get you covered. You could include a lot of fun activities that will also help you burn some calories like swimming, surfing, or even just walking in sand.

Swimming leisurely burns about 300 calories. Walking on sand is actually much more difficult than walking on pavements and requires almost 2.5 times more work than on pavements with the same speed. Even playing frisbee or beach volleyball is good exercise.

Even if you don&#x2019;t do any activity at the beach you can simply exercise by walking in the sand when you try to find a place for settling for the day. Anyhow you will end up working out and turning healthier.

**Beneficial To Skin**

The beach is one of the best places to treat and pamper your skin. It has positive effects on your overall skin health. Not only does it provide tanning which beautifies your skin (sunscreen is a must), there are other immensely beneficial effects of the beach on the skin due to its antibacterial and detoxifying properties.

The most important job the sand does is exfoliate. It acts as a natural exfoliant and removes dead skin cells from your hand and feet, thereby leaving them soft and glowing. Exfoliation keeps the skin healthy and rejuvenated.

Also, the pores that are opened by the warm sun, after coming in contact with salt water, get detoxifies. The sea water goes in and pulls out the toxins thereby getting rid of blemishes, excess oils and dirt. A rejuvenated skin means a rejuvenated you.

**Enhances Your Breathing**

The first thing we do when we reach the beach is that we inhale deeply. This is your body&#x2019;s automatic reaction after being subjected to an improved quality of air. People with breathing problems such as asthma, [COPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease) etc can tell you that they find breathing in the beach easier than any other place.

This has a scientific explanation. The air in and around the beach is charged with negative ions and therefore it increases oxygen absorption in the lungs.

So now you know where you should be headed for your next vacation if you want to rejuvenate yourself and relax. The beach has too many benefits to not go for a vacation. [Sanjay Jhunjhunwala, a famous travel blogger based in Kolkata](https://sanjayjhunjhunwala.net), says that beach vacation may be relaxing only if you plan it properly.

Improper planning could turn the relaxation into pain. He suggests packing your sunscreen, swimsuit, changing clothes, towel, and an extra set of clothes for your ride back so you don&#x2019;t get sand all over yourself. A well-planned beach trip could give you the relaxation and rejuvenation you need.
