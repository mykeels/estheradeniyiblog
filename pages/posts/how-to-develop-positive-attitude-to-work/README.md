There is this nonchalance people show to work that is
 alarming. You see young vibrant people who should be dominating whatever field
 they find themselves but they work with an i-don&#x2019;t-care attitude that not only
 affects their work but also defeats any kind of experience they should have
 learnt from such work. Yet you see these people complaining because they are
 stuck doing the same job at the same level for years.

You see people who know
 what they should do, how they should do it, but for some lazy reason(s) they
 choose to do it haphazardly. I have heard a stock controller once tell me that
 mayonnaise can be used two months after its expiry date. What kind of mentality
 can you say someone like that has? True, the environment we find ourselves
 doesn&#x2019;t always notice the efforts we put in but the personal satisfaction in
 doing something and knowing that you have done an amazing job is immense.

This
 might seem like a tall tale but there is a satisfaction and confidence that
 comes from knowing that you can do any task given to you, not just well but in
 an amazing way. Besides all these, you never know who is watching. I know
 people who have gone far in their carriers simply because they put their hearts
 in their jobs. It wasn&#x2019;t planned, its possible they have been working with
 their hearts for ages and one day, baam&#x2026; they do something, something that
 might seem like another day for them and that changed their lives forever.

First of all, you have to work to derive personal
 satisfaction. I believe that if you work to derive personal satisfaction, you
 won&#x2019;t see something going awry and press ignore. You won&#x2019;t even be confortable
 in your skin. Ant trust me, however you do any job, no matter how little or
 insignificant that job is or how little it pays is the same way you will do any
 other job.So if you are the type that sees something going bad but looks the
 other way since it doesn&#x2019;t concern you, you will take that same attitude
 anywhere you go, even if you are starting something of your own. If you fall
 under the category of people who know how things should be done but still go
 ahead and do it however they please, oga it will follow you wherever you are
 going. You can&#x2019;t even help it. It&#x2019;s in you.

&#xA0;

The kind of satisfaction you get from doing your job right
 is immense. The truth is that 99.99% of people who are excelling in whatever
 field they find themselves are people who put their hearts in their jobs. &#xA0;Try it, have a[ positive attitude with whatever you do](https://blog.udemy.com/positive-attitude-at-work/), do your job with all your heart, and you will see how things will fall
 in place.
