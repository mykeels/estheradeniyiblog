The first time I published this blog post was in 2017. While I was going through my archives, I thought to re-share this again. It is still so relevant today. Enjoy!

The way our mind works is very interesting. One second, we are thinking of buying a new bag, the next, it is on the potatoes about to spoil. In the midst of all of these thoughts, negative thoughts also creep in.

We say we can&#x2019;t help it, negative things just spring up but I say that we can train our minds unto positivity. The information we take in every day does not help matters. There is so much of filth all around us. News, social media, negative talks, daily pressure, everything combine to bring poor thinking.

Some things creep into our minds and by the time we juggle to reality, we are disappointed at how such filth ever cropped up, we wonder where they stem from. We are amazed at how quickly our minds drift into horrible images and conjure negative things.

Below are 3 powerful tips to help overcome negative thinking.

### 1. Meditate on the word of God&#xA0;

Psalm 77:12- &#x201C;I will meditate on all Your work and muse on Your deeds.&#x201D;

[Meditate on God&#x2019;s word](http://www.biblestudytools.com/blogs/founders-ministries-blog/meditating-on-god-s-word.html), meditate on his work and ponder on his deeds. The more of God&#x2019;s words and promises that you read, the fewer negative thoughts you have. In fact, when these thoughts creep in, your knowledge of the word of God is enough to nullify these things as soon as they come up.

You can start by starting your day with the powerful word of God. Be still and meditate on these words. Chew, masticate until there is no more space for negative thoughts. Do you remember [Ilesanmi&#x2019;s advice](https://estheradeniyi.com/3-bright-tips-to-staying-positive/) on not starting the day with newspapers? I think that it&#x2019;s a superb one.

### 2. Feed your mind with positive things&#xA0;

Philippians 4:8 says &#x201C;*Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things*.&#x201D;

Continually listen to uplifting music. Make friends with positive people. Spend your time reading things that will add positively to you. Horror is such a creative genre of movies but if you are not ready to have your mind preoccupied by disgusting things, avoid them.

Sometimes, you may have to do a social media detox. Stay away completely for a whole week and learn to live in the moment. You can also &#x201C;unfollow&#x201D; people who trigger these negative thoughts.

### 3. Be grateful

[Count your blessings](http://library.timelesstruths.org/music/Count_Your_Blessings/) and name them one by one. Be grateful for the little and big things that God has done for you. In fact, when discouraging thoughts surface, list five things the Lord has done for you instantly and see what that does. It helps you realize that the Lord loves you more than the pressing issue at hand.

Many times we forget God&#x2019;s love and begin to dwell on the negative things happening. If you can worry, you can meditate. It&#x2019;s the same process, just different things you are pondering on. So, spend time to appreciate God and watch unnecessary things leave your mind.

Begin to practise these things and get rid of those unnecessary negative thoughts. The Lord wants us to have a peaceful, restful and pure mind. He wants a heart that is devoted to him, allow him that space by dwelling less on negative and more on positive things.

While these negative thoughts are not just all going to go away immediately, every move to get rid of them is a step closer to a life filled with positivity and light.
