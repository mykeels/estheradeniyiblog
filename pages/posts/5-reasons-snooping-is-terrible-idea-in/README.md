Trust is paramount in a relationship. A healthy relationship has to be based on trust. It should be the pillar holding partners together. The thought of snooping should not come to mind when trust exists between lovers.

Lack of trust is the major reason why partners turn themselves to detectives, you want to know what your partner is up to and you &#xA0;forget that all you need to do is ask. If you always feel the urge to snoop on your partner then I think you are in a wrong relationship. Snooping is a terrible idea and can make your relationship toxic.
 Here are 5 [reasons why snooping is terrible in a relationship](https://www.bustle.com/articles/154363-15-relationship-experts-explain-why-snooping-is-a-terrible-idea).

1. You cause yourself a lot of of pain when you snoop on your partner. There is a saying- what you do not see or know about won&#x2019;t hurt you. So you go through you partner&#x2019;s phone hoping to find something incriminating.and after you do you cannot bear what you see. Why look in the first place? Always believe in one another and ask questions about what you would like to know.

2. Snooping can lead to stalking. When you become addicted to snooping then you can stalk your partner on his phone or on social media and at the same time follow your partner around without their knowledge thereby invading their privacy.

3. Snooping makes you look like the untrustworthy one in the relationship because your partner can turn the table on you by saying you are expecting from them the same thing you have been up to. This makes you look stupid at the end of the day.

4. Because you are expecting to see something in your partner&#x2019;s phone or belongings doesn&#x2019;t mean they are up to no good, be careful not to misinterpret what you see.
 5. Snooping can cause misunderstanding between partners. Your partner may prefer that you communicate instead of going about it the wrong way. If you are not careful it can make you go your separate ways.
