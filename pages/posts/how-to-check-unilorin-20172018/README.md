Ever since I posted about the release of **Unilorin 2017/2018 admission list** on my [Facebook wall](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=583544961986429&amp;id=100009927903430), people won&#x2019;t let me hear word again o. Been getting a lot of enquiries and all of that. I have decided to just come and write the reported procedure here.

It is reported because I am not the one looking for this Unilorin Admission o, my time has past since. But really, I feel for Admission seekers. It&#x2019;s been so delayed this year. I don&#x2019;t understand the whole ish. Some say it&#x2019;s because of the change of government, some say it&#x2019;s a lack of synergy between JAMB and Unilorin. Nawa.

There is a **fake Unilorin 2017/2018 admission list** circulating around. In fact, Unilorin has released a press report and &#xA0;asked that you debunk that. The best way to check your admission status is through JAMB portal.

&#xA0;

## Here is the best way to check your Unilorin Admission status :

1. Log on [Jamb&#x2019;s website](http://www.jamb.org.ng/)
 2. Log in to your account by inputting your username (this is your email address) and your password.
 3. &#x200E;Under the options (drop down menu on the top right hand side of the page), you click on CAPS. It is better to use your chrome browser on your tablet or computer.
 4. &#x200E;Click on &#x2018;Admission status&#x2019; at the left hand side of that page.
 5. &#x200E;All your information is out. I wish you good luck guys.

## Quick things to note on JAMB CAPS ADMISSION

-If you see a &#x2018;NOT_ADMITTED&#x2019; notification on your JAMB CAPS PORTAL, it means that you have not been offered provisional admission by your chosen tertiary institution.

&#x2013; Do not click on the ACCEPT icon until you know that you have been offered admission by your institution. When your institution releases their admission list, you will see both the &#x201C;ACCEPT&#x201D; and &#x201C;DECLINE&#x201D; icons.

-If you have not been admitted, just be patient especially if it isn&#x2019;t clearly stated &#x2018;not admitted&#x2019;. Please read this article on [how to overcome overwhelming life issues](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-to-overcome-overwhelming-life-issues) by Ilesanmi Paul. You are going to be fine in the end, trust me.

I will keep you posted on this page as soon as I hear more relevant news to help Unilorin&#x2019;s prospective students on the Unilorin admission list.
