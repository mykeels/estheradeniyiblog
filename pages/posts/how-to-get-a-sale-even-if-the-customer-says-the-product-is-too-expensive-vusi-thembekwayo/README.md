This is one of the best money videos I have watched in a very long time and I honestly can&#x2019;t keep it to myself. In fact, when I shared some of the things I got from Vusi&#x2019;s lecture on my Whatsapp status, people kept asking for a link.

So, I thought,  if it&#x2019;s this good,  it has to be on my blog too. To be honest with you, I was liberated and encouraged. I was equipped also, to drive conversations that will put money in my pocket. The best part is that I don&#x2019;t have to shortchange myself or be arrogant about it.

Really really good.

So,  below, the video. Let me know your thoughts afterward. What your action plan is going forward.
