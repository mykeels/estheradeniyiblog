## Zobo drink and fertility.

Zobo drink does help in boosting your fertility level. It is especially good for men, as it helps in effectively improving your sperm quality. But Zobo drink does not have much of an effect on female fertility. In some cases, women drinking a lot of Zobo can even have lower fertility.

But it is overall good for men as it promotes sperm motility and increases sperm count. If you are a man, combine your Zobo with ginger to drink. This pairing works amazingly well for fertility boosting in men. Zobo drink as earlier said does not really affect female fertility. So as a female, don&#x2019;t drink Zobo and then expect pregnancy after sex. It really does not boost fertility in women.

## Zobo drink and pregnancy.

Well, let&#x2019;s get this straight. Zobo is not good for you if you&#x2019;re pregnant. This is especially very true for women in early pregnancy like in their first trimester. Although Zobo has lots of benefits, it is not advisable and healthy for you if you are carrying a baby in your womb.

Initially, Zobo&#x2019;s antioxidants actually do protect the mother and her fetus from harmful free radicals and other poisonous substances. But that appears to be the only benefit that Zobo offers a pregnant woman and her fetus.

**Why is Zobo harmful to pregnancy**? Some ingredients in the Zobo leaf and drink, lead to bleeding from the woman&#x2019;s uterus or womb and this puts your baby in great danger of being flushed out. To put it simply, Zobo can lead to miscarriage and if you have been trying so hard to get pregnant, and you are now finally pregnant, you don&#x2019;t want to ruin it just because you can&#x2019;t resist the taste of Zobo. If you are pregnant especially in the first three months, it is advised to not drink Zobo.

## Zobo drink and menstruation

A lot of problems happen during the menstrual cycles of some women. Some women have delayed menstrual cycles, irregular cycles or extremely painful menstruation. Thankfully, **zobo drink and menstruation** go hand in hand as it solves a lot of menstrual cycle problems.

Zobo drink helps to relieve of menstrual pains. It is that one drink that takes care of delayed menstruation. Zobo drink in combination with other herbs releases delayed menstruation. This is essentially due to the high concentration of Vitamin C.
