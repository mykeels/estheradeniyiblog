Maybe we have over flogged it but savings is worth the hype and unlike the reputation it has built for itself, it is not as hard as you think. Sure, there&#x2019;s definitely the issue of discipline. There&#x2019;s also that of commitment and intentionality.

But at the end of it all, it is all for the best. If you don&#x2019;t gain anything else, you have cultivated good virtues and learned how to be prudent. Moreover, the assurance of a contingency fund is a good feeling.

Saving money can be considerably easier if we then move on further to cut back on some of the mindless spendings we are used to.

Maybe we have just saved only a few bucks as a result but it is something. If you don&#x2019;t believe me, try to save 200 Naira every day for a year. That&#x2019;s new gadget money for some people.

What clever ways can we cut back on spending to save more? You can read on to have a whopping, gigantic list of ways to cut back on spending, save more, and all without feeling like you are stifled.
