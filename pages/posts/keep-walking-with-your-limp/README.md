Yesterday, I listened to the concluding part of **[Grace Like a Flood by Michael Todd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKwJE2hDwaY)** and some of the things he said stayed with me. I have shared tiny bits on my [whatsapp status](https://estheradeniyi.com/only-44-people-can-view-my-whatsapp-status-updates/) but I can&#x2019;t limit the audience of this message like that.

## The Empowering Grace of God by Michael Todd

I need you, my blog readers to be reassured again today. I want you to pick up with your limp again and get to a better place in boldness.

One of the greatest weapons of the enemy is deceit. He comes at you subtly to suggest things that are clearly against God&#x2019;s word but because of the packaging, you are tempted to reason until you believe it. (John 8:44; 2 Corinthians 11:3)

One of the many lies he pushes at us is that as soon as we slip, God is disgusted and doesn&#x2019;t want anything to do with us anymore. We are better off going deeper into our flaws and slips and sin and just resigning to fate.

He brings us the opinion that God is too holy to accept us but I wonder what the point of salvation and the cross and Christ&#x2019;s death and resurrection is. You see? You see how he convinces us against truth so much that we even forget Biblical facts. Isaiah 1:18

God hasn&#x2019;t asked us to be perfect to come to him. He has asked us to come just as we are because in our weakness, He can be glorified. Imagine that we were all perfect and flawless, what would we need God for? Your guess is as good as mine, nothing.

**Will You Take Me As I Am by Lecrae** was one of my most played songs some years ago. You can try to look for the song, it&#x2019;s beautiful and sincere.

Paul in the scriptures confessed to his weakness and how he wasn&#x2019;t able to do what he wanted to do because of his slips. Nevertheless he kept on walking with his limp. See for yourself in&#xA0;Romans 7:19-25

New International Version (NIV)

&#x201C;19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do&#x2014;this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.

21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.

22 For in my inner being I delight in God&#x2019;s law;

23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.

24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?

25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!

So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God&#x2019;s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.&#x201D;

What are those flaws that [draw you away from your worship](https://estheradeniyi.com/distractions-from-god-what-can-we-do/) and your fellowship with God, ask the Holy Spirit to help you overcome them. You can&#x2019;t do it on your own. If you could, you would have been able to in all these years.

Invite God into your weak spots and keep on walking with your limp anyway. Keep on pressing on in boldness and joy because God loves you just like that. He is fine with you depending on him.

I have decided to share the **lyrics of Limp by Jonathan McReynolds** with you. Every word and sentence means deep things to me so try love up on the lyrics.

## (Lyrics) Limp by Jonathan McReynolds

Hey now

It&#x2019;s a little deep

I&#x2019;m tired, broken
 Innocence stolen
 And I know I&#x2019;m
 A different man
 See life hits and life hurts
 Think I&#x2019;ve seen
 Some of life&#x2019;s worst
 But you&#x2019;ve been here
 So you understand
 See I fell
 and I broke something
 But I couldn&#x2019;t tell cause I kept running
 Away from your love and grace
 So my trips
 And my pains
 My failures they only make
 Me desperate
 To seek your face
 The devil hoped this injury would make me stop
 And take defeat
 But I know Jesus walks with me

So I&#x2019;ll just keep on walking with my limp limp limp limp
 Just keep on walking with my limp limp limp limp
 Just keep on walking with limp limp limp limp
 Just keep on walking with my limp limp limp limp

I&#x2019;m imperfect, so I slipped up
 And I had my heart
 ripped up
 But you&#x2019;re the lifter
 Of my head
 (of my head)
 So please come
 And please heal
 How I think and how I feel
 And I&#x2019;ll live by what you say
 And you said
 Heavy laden come to me
 The sick, the flawed, the lame, the weak
 And I&#x2019;ll be everything you need

So I&#x2019;ll just keep on walking with my limp limp limp limp
 Just keep on walking with my limp limp limp limp
 Just keep on walking with my limp limp limp limp
 just keep on walking with my limp limp limp limp

Limps are
 Every weakness
 Limps are every flaw
 That keeps us from having
 An otherwise perfect walk
 And we were born
 Handicapped
 But God gives us strength back
 And all that you lack
 If you just keep on walking with your Limp

I&#x2019;ll pursue, victory
 Cause when they beat you
 You look just like me
 You were struggling with your passion
 And your love
 It kept you walking with your limp
 Calvary walking with your limp
 No matter what they said you kept walking with your limp
 Yea that&#x2019;s my savior with his limp
 Just so one day
 I could walk with my limp limp limp limp
 And I could still be loved
 even with my limp limp limp limp
 And I could still be used even with my limp limp limp limp
 and I could still be saved even with my limp

So I&#x2019;ll just keep on walking with my limp
