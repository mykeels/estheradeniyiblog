About a week ago, I joined a gym. It is the most mental sapping exercise in a long time. It involves a lot of your physical energy but you have to be mentally strong alongside.

So after the second session, I thought of giving up but I already paid for 2 months. See, if you are going to take workout with a professional fitness trainer seriously, you should register for more than a month.

If you value money, you will find it difficult to quit. Well, that was the case here too. I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to stop going so I continued.

One morning, I woke up and could barely walk. I do not think that my pain threshold is low so when I say I could barely walk, I meant I was in pains. It was worse by evening.

A friend had advised me not to go on painkillers. He said essential oils or other natural methods of numbing the pain would be perfect. In addition, I was to use my limbs and body like nothing happened.

Oh my! You know I am a member of Young Living Essential oils but as of now, I have not purchased the essential oil fitness pack so I decided to look for oils that could serve as an alternative.

I began to diffuse and inhale AromaEase. At night, I would apply Deep Relief essential oil roll-on at the back of my neck and my temples.

**AromaEase has the following ingredients :**

Mentha piperita&#x2020; (Peppermint) oil
 Mentha spicata&#x2020; (Spearmint) leaf extract
 Zingiber officinale&#x2020; (Ginger) root oil
 Elettaria cardamomum&#x2020; (Cardamom) seed oil
 Foeniculum vulgare&#x2020; (Fennel) oil
 &#x2020;100% pure, therapeutic-grade essential oil

**Deep Relief Essential oil roll on by Young Living contains the following :**

Peppermint (Mentha piperita)
 Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea)
 Clove (Syzygium aromaticum)
 Vetiver
 Wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbes)
 Lemon (Citrus limon)
 Helichrysum (Helichrysum italicum)
 Copaiba (Copaifera reticulate)
 Coconut oil.

It worked like magic so I concluded, this combination would be a perfect workout companion.

I diffused Aromaease the next morning in my neck Chain diffuser and also applied Deep Relief essential oil roll-on as liberally as possible.

I remember chatting my trainer up to say I feel nada. No pain!

Maybe you want to rev your workout and gym sessions, you should try this combo. Luckily, you can carry them around and you won&#x2019;t even notice.
