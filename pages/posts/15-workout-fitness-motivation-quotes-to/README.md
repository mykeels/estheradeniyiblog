Sometimes you can&#x2019;t pick yourself up to workout. The longer it takes to pick yourself up and get on track, the harder. Below are workout and fitness motivational quotes to get you up sooner and keep you focused for a long time.

1. &#x201C;In training, you listen to your body. In
 competition, you tell your body to shut up.&#x201D;

&#x2013; Rich Froning Jr., four-time CrossFit Games
 champion

2. &#x201C;If something stands between you and your success, move it.
 Never be denied.&#x201D; &#x2013; Dwayne &#x201C;The Rock&#x201D; Johnson, professional wrestler and actor

3. &#x201C;A fit, healthy body&#x2014;that is the best fashion statement&#x201D; &#x2013; Jess C. Scott

4. &#x201C;The individual who says it is not possible should move out
 of the way of those doing it.&#x201D;

-Tricia Cunningham

5. &#x201C;Sometimes people will hear you and be able to change their
 behavior, but often their behavior has more to do with their own need for
 approval than with your need for support. No matter what their response, you
 need to be firm and hold your ground. At the end of the day, your health is
 your responsibility.&#x201D; -Jillian Michaels, Winning by Losing: Drop the Weight,
 Change Your Life

6. &#x201C;Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but nobody wants to
 lift no heavy-ass weights.&#x201D; &#x2013; Ronnie Coleman

7. &#x201C;Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will
 take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.&#x201D; &#x2013; Earl Nightingale

8. &#x201C;Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what [keeps you going](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/dont-give-up-keep-pushing).&#x201D; &#x2013; Jim Ryan

9. &#x201C;You gain strength, courage and confidence by every
 experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face&#x2026; Do the thing you
 think you cannot do.&#x201D; &#x2013; Eleanor Roosevelt

10. &#x201C;PATIENCE: Let&#x2019;s be realistic here. You won&#x2019;t drop two jean
 sizes in one day. You won&#x2019;t lose fifty pounds in one month. You&#x2019;re going to
 binge every now and then. You will go a day or two without working out. Your
 weight is going to fluctuate here and there. You&#x2019;re going to try new techniques
 and they&#x2019;re not going to work, You&#x2019;re a human being. You&#x2019;re going to fail. But
 nothing great is ever accomplished without a few obstacles. [JUST KEEP GOING](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/lose-weight-by-just-walking-no-gym-no)!!!!!&#x201D;

11. &#x201C;If you want something you&#x2019;ve never had, you must be willing
 to do something you&#x2019;ve never done.&#x201D; &#x2013; Thomas Jefferson

12. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve all read the latest article on the
 popular muscle building sites about how to develop a fuller, thicker back with
 &#x201C;these 2 NEW maximal hypertrophy igniting muscle shocking lifts!&#x201D; The title
 lures you in, but when you get inside, you find a small man doing strange
 movements that make little sense and use almost no weight. They aren&#x2019;t making
 him any thicker, and they aren&#x2019;t likely to add slabs of lean mass to you
 either.&#x201D; &#x2013; Jordan Martin

13. &#x201C;If you can&#x2019;t explain the essence of your program to a
 three-year old in 60 seconds, its too complicated. I&#x2019;ve trained with Olympic
 medal winners and I can assure you, they don&#x2019;t do anything mysterious, they
 just do the exercises better than we do.&#x201D; &#x2013;&#xA0; Maik Weidenbach

14. &#x201C;Some people like to live without too much risk.
 They&#x2019;re satisfied leading a safe existence. This attitude of caution
 infiltrates into their goals. Every successful athlete &#x2013; or businessperson &#x2013;
 enjoys taking calculated risks. You have to. Especially in the gym when you&#x2019;re
 squatting 500 for reps and you can&#x2019;t get one more but grunt out ten. Your nose
 starts bleeding, you fall into the rack and that&#x2019;s set one.&#x201D; -Tom Platz

&#xA0;

15. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s more to life than training, but training is
 what puts more in your life.&#x201D; &#x2013; Brooks Kubik
