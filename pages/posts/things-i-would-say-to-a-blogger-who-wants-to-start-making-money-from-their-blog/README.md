We used to have to convince people that it is possible to make money from your blog and that people, actual human beings, human beings in flesh and blood make money from their blogs. Some people are still in denial, others are [wondering how it works](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-do-i-earn-money-as-blogger/), some others know that this is the case and they really really want to start making money from their blogs.

This blog post is for the latter. It also means that to have something tangible to take away from this blog post, you have a blog and you are ready to monetize. A lot of people make mistakes when it is time to start making money from their blogs.

I made all of those mistakes too. I won&#x2019;t lie to you or come put myself forward like the pro that had everything all figured out from day 1. What I do not want is that you make all of the mistakes I made. It just goes to say that my experience was a waste if I do not share them and warn people who are about to get disappointed.

This post is going to be brief and straight to the point!

![](images\3-THINGS-TO-KNOW-IF-YOU-MUST-MAKE-MONEY-FROM-YOUR-BLOG.png)

*1.&#xA0; Never put all your eggs in one basket*

When you start earning from a particular source, it is very easy to stay on that. I think this is just a case of being too comfortable. As long as the bucks are rolling in, who cares? Well, you should. You see, as soon as you begin to consider making money from your blog, consider it a business.

It is just that business that brings you fulfillment. No business person will tell you that they depend on only one source because if you stay on just one source:

*i. you are missing out on other countless opportunities to increase your income stream;*

*ii. your main income stream might be cut suddenly, you never know.*

So, as soon as you start making money from Google AdSense or Mediavine or Adthrive, don&#x2019;t sit on it, check if you can build a digital product and sell. You might also begin to look into publishing sponsored posts and collaborating with brands. What of affiliate marketing, check sites you can work with. You can sell your own services as well.

I sell one on one courses; what I do is teach people how to blog and move up very fast, how to make money from their blogs also. I also design blogs and optimize them for search engines. What skills do you have that you can monetize? In this blog post, I share the [unpopular way to make money from your blog](https://estheradeniyi.com/make-money-as-a-blogger/).

*Be flexible*

That a Blogger is making money from sponsored posts does not mean that you also will make it in that area. It depends on a whole lot of things. For example, if you are detached from your blog, people rarely see you on it at all, you don&#x2019;t even have an &#x201C;about me&#x201D; page, to begin with, it might be difficult for people to approach you for sponsored posts.

It will be unfair to all of your hard work to then stay on it and never look elsewhere. Some Bloggers make a lot of money from Google AdSense, some have never even made up to $10 for years. I can teach you what to do to make much more than that in just a month, you can send me an email if you are interested.

The point here is that you should be flexible enough to know when something is not working and it is time to tweak your funnel or look into another source of income for your blog. Don&#x2019;t be too hard on yourself if one method does not work for you.

*Do not monetize too early&#xA0;*

Monetizing too early can put you under pressure and shift your focus away from the main thing &#x2013; blogging. Monetizing your blog too early is beginning to look for sponsorship or applying to ad networks as early as just a month into blogging.

You should even have enough posts, to begin with!

If you approach brand A and they turn you down, apply for Google AdSense and they reject you or start to market a product you have just built and end up with zero sales, it might affect your blogging mojo.

If you are new into blogging, this is the time to make posts that are super relevant or very interesting or stunning. It is the time to begin to learn about your readers, find your voice, see how blogging itself works.

If you are doing things right, before you even begin to implement a monetization strategy, people might begin to call you for collaborations. You might even begin to get emails from people asking to work with you.

Monetizing your blog is like making money from any other kind of business. So, treat the whole process that way. Provide unbeatable value, be flexible and look into as many streams as possible.
