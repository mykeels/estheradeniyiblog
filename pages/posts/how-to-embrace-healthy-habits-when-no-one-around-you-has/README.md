It&#x2019;s always tough to be the person who stands out from the crowd and does things a bit differently, and it&#x2019;s even tougher when you are trying to commit to making positive changes in your life but other people around you are not willing to join in.

You may start to feel all alone, even if you are surrounded by other people, and that&#x2019;s a common frustration among people who are working to live healthier and do good things for their body. They have to deal with people who don&#x2019;t understand what they are doing or who are living their lives in an entirely opposite way.

We are going to look at a few things you can do to reinforce and develop healthy habits, even when nobody in your life is doing the same.

**Keep Your Motivation and Goals in Sight**

It is easy to lose focus of what you are trying to achieve when everyone else is doing something different. One way to keep those things very present in your mind is to write them down and look at them each day.

Maybe you can put them as the background on your phone. Or you could place them by your bathroom mirror to read when you [go through your morning routine](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-best-morning-routine-for-successful-boss-babes/) each day.

You need to put those goals first and foremost in your mind and in your daily life, and it is the number one step that most experts will list for you as well. Writing down your goals also [forms a connection](https://lifehacker.com/why-you-learn-more-effectively-by-writing-than-by-typin-5738093) between you and them, helping cement them as a part of your being.

**Schedule Your Time**

You have to make time for your healthy habits. If you just try to squeeze them into whatever time is left in your day, then you will not make time for them most days. You will end up just like your friends and family around you and just go for the easy route.

When you schedule in time to do something healthy, such as go for a run, prepare a nutritious meal or visit the gym, then you are more likely to follow through with it. You don&#x2019;t want to plan out your healthy activities on the fly, though. It is better to have them planned out in advance, for the entire week at least. That way, when you friends ask you if you want to do something that will detract from your healthy lifestyle, you can always tell them what you have planned for the day and stick to your goals.

**Stop Restricting Yourself All the Time**

One of the top [reasons why most diets fail](https://www.thediabetescouncil.com/why-do-most-diets-fail/) is because people just take away all the fun things they want to eat. You can find a way to enjoy the foods and drinks that you like while still keeping to your healthy living goals.

If you like coffee but find that you put too much sugar in it to make it a part of your new diet, then you can simply lower the sugar levels by making the coffee yourself or use a sugar substitute, such as honey, agave or even cinnamon.

You may be surprised at how well you take to the alternatives, and you can do the same thing for any unhealthy foods or drinks that you have been depriving yourself of for your diet. If you just restrict everything that you love, then you will get discouraged and frustrated and will be more likely to [stop your diet or to binge eat. ](https://estheradeniyi.com/what-to-do-after-you-binge-eat/)

**Set Reasonable Goals**

It&#x2019;s tough to keep up with your goals when you set them too high. If you are aiming for perfection every day, then you will feel [frustrated](http://routineexcellence.com/why-do-you-set-unrealistic-goals/) constantly, and eventually you will give up.

Start small and work your way up, all while being aware of your limitations. If you are realistic with your goals and standards, then you can accomplish more and reach your eventual goals faster.

**Get Good Help**

Even if you are the only one in your life who is trying to live healthy, you can still get some help you keep you going on.

Use online resources that empower you to find the right gear for whatever workout you are doing, such as [Jogging Addiction. ](https://joggingaddiction.com/)

Connect with trainers and other people trying to live healthy by joining healthy living forums, local jogging communities, or the gym.

Make new friends and get professional advice about setting goals and working out. This will help you create a sense of unity with others and leave you feeling not so alone, and it will probably help you more than anything else. That&#x2019;s because working with other people and communicating your goals with them keeps you accountable and motivated.

**Conclusion**

These are just a few tips to get you started, and we wish you only success as you start this new chapter in your life. Remember that with attainable goals and the right motivation, you can accomplish anything. These methods can empower you to do just that.
