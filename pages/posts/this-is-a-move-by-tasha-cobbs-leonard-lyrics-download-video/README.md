## This is a move by Tasha Cobbs Lyrics

So&#xA0;the song says

That mountains are still being moved
 Strongholds are still being loosed
 God, we believe
 &#x2018;Cause yes, we can see it
 That wonders are still what you do

Check : [Break every chain by Tasha Cobbs](https://estheradeniyi.com/break-every-chain-lyrics/)

And bodies are still being raised
 Giants are still being slayed
 God, we believe
 Yes, we can see it
 That wonders are still what you do

We are here for you
 Come and do what you do
 We are here for you
 Come and do what you do
 We set our hearts on you
 Come and do what you do
 &#x2018;Cause we need a move
 We need a move
 (Can you shout that out? We need a move)
 We need a move, yeah
 We need a move

And bodies are still being raised, hey!
 Giants are still being slayed, oh!
 God, we believe
 And yes, we can see it
 That wonders are still what you do

We are here for you
 Come and do what you do
 We are here for you
 You&#x2019;re the only thing that matters!
 You&#x2019;re the only one that matters
 We set our hearts on you
 Come and do what you do
 Oh, we need you to move
 Oh, we need a move
 We need a move
 Sing, we need a move
 We need a move
 Oh, we need a move

Also : [I&#x2019;m getting ready by Tasha Cobbs ft Nicki Minaj](https://estheradeniyi.com/im-getting-ready-by-tasha-cobbs-f/)

Miracles&#xA0;happen when you move
 Healing is coming in this room
 Miracles happen when you move
 Heaven is coming
 Somebody say it!

Miracles happen when you move
 Healing is coming in this room
 Miracles happen when you move
 Heaven is coming
 You got one more time!
 Shout it out, sing!

Miracles happen when you move
 Healing is coming in this room
 Miracles happen when you move
 Heaven is coming, oh!

Also : [Gracefully broken by Tasha Cobbs](https://estheradeniyi.com/gracefully-broken-by-tasha-cobbs-lyrics/)

This is a move
 This is a move
 We&#x2019;re standing in the middle of a move
 This is a move
 This is a move
 It&#x2019;s the one you&#x2019;ve been waiting for
 This is a move
 This is a move
 He&#x2019;s about to do what he does
 You&#x2019;ve been&#xA0;waiting
 And you&#x2019;ve been fasting
 And you&#x2019;ve been praying
 This is a move
 Somebody say this is a move!
 Oh, this is a move
 Yes it is!
 Somebody throw your hands up and say it
 This is a move
 Oh, this is a move

Also : [Your Spirit by Tasha Cobbs](https://estheradeniyi.com/your-spirit-tasha-cobbs-lyrics-download/)

We are here for you
 Come and do what you do
 (Somebody say)
 We are here for you
 Come and do what you do
 Set our hearts on you
 Come and do what you do
 We need a move
 We need a move
 We need a move
 We need a move
 Do what you wanna do!
 We&#x2019;re waiting on you!
 We need a move
 We&#x2019;ve been waiting for you
 Oh, we&#x2019;ve been praying for you
 We need a move
 We&#x2019;ve been praying for it
 We need a move
 We&#x2019;ve been fasting for it
 We need a move
 Oh, this is a move
 You&#x2019;ve been waiting
 And you&#x2019;ve been praying
 You&#x2019;ve been waiting
 And you&#x2019;ve been praying
 For this here right now
 Have your way, have your way&#x2026;
 Oh, move by your spirit!
 Move by your spirit!
 Move by your spirit!
 Move by your spirit!
 Move by your spirit, God!
 This is a move!&#x2026;
