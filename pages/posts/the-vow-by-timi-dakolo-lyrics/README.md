Intro

What&#x2019;d I do if I don&#x2019;t have you
If I don&#x2019;t have you&#x2026;. I&#x2019;m screwed

Verse 1

I&#x2019;ve had a lot of good times
I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of pain
Had a little sunshine
Had my share of rain
But there&#x2019;s nothing in this world
Compared to the joy I have
Whenever I&#x2019;m with you

Known you for a long time
We&#x2019;ve come a long way
You were like my sunshine
After a stormy day
They say that love is blind
But I can it through your eyes
Girl you give me so much happiness
And I wanna give you nothing less

Chorus

 I promise to be true
To give my all to you
No matter what they say
This heart belongs to you
I thank the Lord above
For giving you to me
Forever&#x2019;s just a start
Forever&#x2019;s you and me

What&#x2019;d I do if I don&#x2019;t have you
 If I don&#x2019;t have you&#x2026;. I&#x2019;m screwedVerse 2

 See life is like a journey
 It&#x2019;s full of ups and downs
 No matter what you go through
 I&#x2019;ll always be around
 We&#x2019;ll take our hopes and dreams
 Turn them to reality&#x2026; baby
 TogetherSee I will be your lover
 And I will be your friend
 I&#x2019;ll love you like no other
 Until the very end
 They say that love is blind
 But I can see it through our eyes
 Girl you give me so much happiness
 And I wanna give you nothing less
Chorus

 I promise to be true
 To give my all to you
 No matter what they say
 This heart belongs to you
 I thank the Lord above
 For giving you to me
 Forever&#x2019;s just a start
 Forever&#x2019;s you and me

&#xA0;

Baby I&#x2019;ll&#x2026;
Be your soldier, fight your battles

Baby I&#x2019;ll&#x2026;
Be a shoulder, you can lean on

Baby I&#x2019;ll&#x2026;
Be your husband and your best friend

And there&#x2019;s nothing that I wouldn&#x2019;t do
Just to prove to you, I&#x2019;ll be true to you

Chorus (Modulation)

I promise to be true
To give my all to you
No matter what they say
This heart belongs to you
I thank the Lord above
For giving you to me
Forever&#x2019;s just a start
Forever&#x2019;s you and me

Another Modulation

I thank the Lord above
I thank the Lord above
I thank the Lord above
Forever&#x2019;s just a start
Forever&#x2019;s you and me

Another Modulation

I promise to be true
 To give my all to you
 No matter what they say
 This heart belongs to you
 I thank the Lord above
 For giving you to me
 Forever&#x2019;s just a start
 Forever&#x2019;s you and me

I thank the Lord above
I thank the Lord above

I thank the Lord above

Forever&#x2019;s just a start
 Forever&#x2019;s you and me

Uh uh uh uh uh
Forever&#x2019;s you and me

You know, Timi Dakolo has a way with words and love. He is my one of my favorite singers, y&#x2019;all know abi? Especially when he released his [Iyawo mi](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/iyawo-mi-by-timi-dakolo-lyrics)song. One thing I have come to learn from Timi Dakolo is that your personal experience helps you describe concepts very accurately. His love life is an admirable one.

In his words,&#xA0;&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been 4 years of
 learning and loving with my wife. I believe there is no better time to release
 this single and video than now. I call it my gift to her and I want the world
 to share it with me and their special one.&#x201D;

The Vow which was produced by Cobhams Asuquo was released to celebrate his 4th Wedding anniversary on March 31, 2016. Enjoy the lyrics and the song below:
