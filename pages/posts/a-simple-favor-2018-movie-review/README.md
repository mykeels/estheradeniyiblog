## A Simple Favor movie trailer

If you are familiar with my odd [movie chronicles](https://estheradeniyi.com/category/movies/), you would definitely understand why **A Simple Favor** wasn&#x2019;t planned. I actually set out to watch a movie, didn&#x2019;t know which. So I am the kind of girl that all of a sudden just wants to be in the cinema. [The cinema is one of my favorite hang out spots](https://estheradeniyi.com/ozone-cinemas-yaba/) actually. When I am feeling overwhelmed with Blogging or working with clients, I end up at the cinema.

Except for very few times, all of which I can count, I don&#x2019;t go to the cinema deciding what movie to watch. So I get there, look at movie schedules and times, pick one and hope to God it&#x2019;s good. Only once have I ever regretted my process. I left the cinema barely 30 minutes into the movie! Please let me know if you are like this.

## A Simple Favor Movie Review

The first thing I said to my friend was that all the characters are psychos. Like, every single person in the movie is psychotic. Lol. I just wondered how they would survive day to day real life living without going crazy.

I enjoyed the story for the most part. The many twists made it too complicated for me, not in an interesting way. I felt too many things were muddled up, somehow they managed to get it through.

The acting was on point Y&#x2019;all. So, Anna Kendrick. The only one time she left a strong impression was with Pitch Perfect, all three parts. I have always pictured her in the schoolgirl person, young and experimental.

To see her take on the motherly acting role was a pleasant one. I liked many of the parts she came on screen.

### A Simple Favor Plot

I will try not to be to A Simple Movie Spoiler, I promise to give a brief summary of the story so that you have an idea of how the 1hour 59 minutes of your life will be spent.

A Simple Favor is based on **Darcey Bell&#x2019;s 2017 Novel** and was directed by Paul Feig. In A Simple Favor, Anna Kendrick who&#x2019;s Stephanie is a single mother of one son with multitasking abilities enough to wow the other mothers. One of her many projects is a Vlog. It is no wonder I fell in love instantly. I love content creators, very much.

Blake Lively plays Emily, another school mum. Their sons bring them together and they become friends of some sort. That was going to be the beginning of Stephanie&#x2019;s problem, or not. Her past has been pretty dramatic!

We are beautifully led on to unpredictable scenes with a lot of roller coasters. In a bid to find a missing Emily, everything changes and we are left wondering, &#x201C;[what happened to Emily](https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/a-simple-favor-ending-explained-13262866)?&#x201D;
