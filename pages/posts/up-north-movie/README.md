 I am so liking the &#x201C;**Up North**&#x201D; movie vibes. This time [Adesua](https://estheradeniyi.com/adesua-etomi/) isn&#x2019;t married to Banky W, she is married to her best friend&#x2019;s husband. Well, in the movie lol.

It looks as though they are having so much fun in the movie. The trailer is almost perfect for staging the right kind of new movie yearn.

Adesua is so fine in Up North and I&#xA0;think she looks the part, the Hausa part.

In collaboration with Inkblot Productions and Anakle Films, multiple award-winning filmmaker, Tope Oshin, announced the film **Up North**.
