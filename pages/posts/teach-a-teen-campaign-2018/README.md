On Monday, June 4th 2018, Teens Going for Gold Network, an organization dedicated to educating, empowering and inspiring teenagers to becoming social change agents and financially self-reliant, started the second edition of her Teach a Teen program. The program whose primary objectives are to increase the quality of education and reduce the rates of poverty and unemployment in Nigeria, has two major components &#x2013; the campaign and the training sessions.

The #TeachATeen campaign advocates for an educational curriculum and system that meets up with the needs, challenges and changes of the 21st century &#xA0;while the training component, with a usual duration of three days, focuses on freely providing opportunities that increase the entrepreneurial, vocational and leadership aptitudes of students in rural secondary schools or other institutions. The ultimate goal pf the campaign is to influence policy makers to make inclusive and quality education a priority in Nigeria.

In 2017, the training program had 147 beneficiaries in the Nigerian cities of Benin, Ibadan and Lagos in partnership with participants of the Young African Leaders Initiative RLC West Africa.
