 Omg, &#xA0;Lara George is back with a new single -Nobody Greater &#x2013; and I can&#x2019;t stop listening to it. It&#x2019;s really beautiful, I tell you. &#x2018;Nobody Greater&#x2019; by Lara George is so powerful it&#x2019;s been on repeat since I downloaded it. I find this a Spirit lifting and reassuring song.
