## Awamaridi by Nathaniel Bassey Lyrics

You are the beginning and ending, alpha and omega
 You seated in the circle of the earth
 You are the God who made the universe, out of void and emptiness
 You spoke the word and it fell into place
 You&#x2019;re deeper than my myth can grasp and what my eyes can see
 Eternity won&#x2019;t be enough to tell of you
 As long as I got breathe in me, and through the great beyond
 I&#x2019;ll declare the greatness of your name

Also: [Halleluyah Amen by Nathaniel Bassey](https://estheradeniyi.com/download-lyrics-halleluyah-amen-by-nathaniel-bassey/)

Awamaridi, awamaridi, ooh&#x2026;
 You are mystery reveals to me your own
 So I&#x2019;ve come to worship you
 I&#x2019;ve come to worship you

The heavens after heavens cannot contain your majesty
 And yet you made my heart your dwelling place
 I find it hard to understand, the reason for this kind of love
 For mortal men who sometimes doesn&#x2019;t care
 You took the journey to the cross, and never looking back
 You die the sinners death so I can live again
 If this is not the greatest love, I wonder what is
 It can only take a God who is like you&#x2026; Jesus

Also: [Amen Chant by Nathaniel Bassey](https://estheradeniyi.com/amen-chant-by-nathaniel-bassey/)

Awamaridi, awamaridi, ooh&#x2026;
 You are mystery reveals to me your own
 Awamaridi, awamaridi, ooh&#x2026;
 So I&#x2019;ve come to worship you
 I&#x2019;ve come to worship you
 Cause I live to worship you
 I live to worship you
