I am so excited to have been able to finally launch my podcast. This has been a long time coming. I have procrastinated and procrastination is tired already.

Three of the reasons I have started &#x201C;[adulting on the go](https://anchor.fm/esther-adeniyi)&#x201D; are:

- to share some of the experiences that are noteworthy enough to build lessons from;
- to find a creative outlet to express myself;
- and to build a more personal relationship with my blog readers.

You can click on play to listen to my first episode, *Cutting Corners and Burning Bridges*. I would be really glad to have feedback and know what you think of the first episode. Thank you!
