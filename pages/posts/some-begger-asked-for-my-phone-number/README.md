Have you ever been hungry, tired and soiled down there with monthly messy blood all at the same time?

I was all of that and angry. On top of all of the internal war, I was angry that I was angry. That was when Mr Dude decides to spew an &#x2018;excuse me&#x2019;. And he was across the road for that matter. I needed no seer to tell me that I would get home minutes later than the estimated time I had in my head.

No, I normally don&#x2019;t even wait. Sad, I had to. I just wanted to do something right. I was angry and that made me feel so out of control. I wanted to be kind, at least.

He hurriedly appeared beside me and muttered some words. I was too blind to hear them. 10 seconds into his speech, my brain picked up &#x2019;em sound waves. He needed 100 Naira.

As long as 100 Naira would be the price to pay you to get out of my face, oh dear, have it!

So I searched for an 100 note. My stomach growled! It wanted indomie and egg. I didn&#x2019;t find and so I dumped the 200 note in his hands.

Why he wasn&#x2019;t turning quickly to clear the road made me curse the god of the sun. It hit me in the middle of my braids. It was such a bad time to be out.

&#x201C;Sister, don&#x2019;t be annoyed. Do you live around this place?&#x201D;

&#x201C;No. Ehn, yes&#x201D;

&#x201D; Please can I ask you for your number? &#x201D;

My inner man shed a drop of tear. The only evil I did was stop to give him 200 Naira. My Always pad was full to the brim! No wonder babies cry when their pampers are full. No wonder.

I gently walked away. All of the instant predicament humbled me. I reached the breaking point and broke. That humbled me.

If you see him, please tell him to return my 200 Naira. He is tall, dark and handsome.
