## &#xA0;If All I Say Is Jesus (Revamped) By Dunsin Oyekan Lyrics

Intro
 Yeah eh

(Dunsin Oyekan)
 You have captured my heart
 Consumed my heart with Your love

(Jesus)
 You have captured my heart
 Consumed my heart with Your love

(Somebody lift it up and say)
 You have captured my heart
 Consumed my heart with Your love

Also: [Songs of Angels (Kei Yadosh)](https://estheradeniyi.com/song-of-angels-kei-yadosh-dunsin-oyekan/)

(I love You, Jesus)
 You have captured my heart
 Consumed my heart with Your love

If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

(Somebody say, If all I say)
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

Also: [Olowogbogboro by Nathaniel Bassey](https://estheradeniyi.com/olowogboboro-lyrics-nathaniel-bassey/)

(The Name that is above every other name)
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

(Tasha Page-Lockhart and Dunsin)
 You have captured my heart
 Consumed my heart with Your love

You have captured my heart
 Consumed my heart with Your love

If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

(I will never be ashamed to Call Your Name)
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

Also: [Jesus at the center by Eben](https://estheradeniyi.com/jesus-at-center-by-eben-lyrics-mp3/)

(You&#x2019;re the answer to it all)
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

(One more time, Lift Your voice)
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

(My Jesus, Sweet Jesus)
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

(Tasha Page-Lockhart and Dunsin Oyekan)
 I can never call Your Name in vain
 Jesus, Jesus
 I can never call Your Name in vain
 Jesus, Jesus

I can never call Your Name in vain
 Jesus, Jesus
 I can never call Your Name in vain
 Jesus, Jesus

(Transpose)
 I can never call Your Name in vain
 Jesus, Jesus
 I can never call Your Name in vain
 Jesus, Jesus

If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

(I will never be ashamed to call Your Name)
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

(There is healing in the Name, There is deliverance in the Name)
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough
 If all I say is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 That&#x2019;s more than enough

You&#x2019;re my healer
 Jesus
 You&#x2019;re my deliver
 Jesus
 My Strong Tower
 Jesus
 Say the Name
