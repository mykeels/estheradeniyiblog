[The Greatest Showman](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-greatest-showman-movie-review/) was a movie hit and **Never&#xA0; Enough** seems to be never enough for anyone who&#x2019;s experienced this.

I stumbled on this on [James Charles&#x2019; YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucot-Zp428OwkyRm2I7v2Q) and I can&#x2019;t but share it. This cover is the truth fam.

I must warn you, James Charles is a weirdo, lol.

## **Never Enough Cover ft Cimorelli**

## Never Enough Lyrics

**Never Enough by Loren Allred**

I&#x2019;m trying to hold my breath
 Let it stay this way
 Can&#x2019;t let this moment end
 You set off a dream in me
 Getting louder now
 Can you hear it echoing?
 Take my hand
 Will you share this with me?
 &#x2018;Cause darling without you

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
 All the stars we steal from the nightsky
 Will never be enough
 Never be enough
 Towers of gold are still too little
 These hands could hold the world but it&#x2019;ll
 Never be enough
 Never be enough

For me
 Never, never
 Never, never
 Never, for me
 For me
 Never enough
 Never enough
 Never enough
 For me
 For me
 For me

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
 All the stars we steal from the nightsky
 Will never be enough
 Never be enough
 Towers of gold are still too little
 These hands could hold the world but it&#x2019;ll
 Never be enough
 Never be enough

For me
 Never, never
 Never, never
 Never, for me
 For me
 Never enough
 Never, never
 Never enough
 Never, never
 Never enough
 For me
 For me
 For me

For me
