&#x201C;CONTINUALLY recognizing the need for more diversity and
 female participation in the traditionally male high-technology industry, Cisco
 Systems Inc, has programmes and resources to help women develop their skills as
 individual contributors, managers, and executives, (Cisco connect) including an internal
 employee resource group dedicated to the development of women, called the Cisco
 Connected Women, CCW.&#x201D;- [Vanguard](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/10/women-ict-cisco-empowers-4000-women/)

Over the last ten years, CCW has offered more than 4000
 global members opportunities for development, networking and generating new
 business. Cisco ConnectIt contributes to a strategic effort to enhance Cisco&#x2019;s success in
 attracting, developing and retaining talented female employees.

Speaking about females participating in the technology
 industry, Olakunle Oloruntimehin, Country Manager, Cisco Nigeria said: &#x201C;In the
 context of a male-dominated industry, Cisco is making intent-based decisions to
 promote inclusiveness, diversity and overall female participation in the
 industry. Cisco has a number of employee networks to support the development,
 and growth opportunities of staff; the Cisco Sales Associates Programmes, CSAP,
 is one of such opportunities. In Nigeria, CSAP aims to empower men and women
 alike helping them realise their dreams of [being ICT leaders](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/introducing-computer-science-education).

&#x201C;It is an early-in-career development programme designed
 specifically for top university graduates from around the world who aspire to
 become the next generation of sales leaders at Cisco. The year long programme
 provides hands-on educational and experiential training that will prepare
 associate sales representatives, ASR and associate systems engineers, ASE,
 become successful account managers and system engineers in the Cisco sales
 organisation.&#x201D; Cisco Connect

Tolulope Ogundipe a female Cisco employee expressed her
 views on the CSAP programme stating that it provided her tremendous growth
 experience that stretched her skills and abilities over the elastic limit. She
 said,&#x201C;The entire experience for me has been exhilarating; working with
 colleagues from over 12 countries and forming life time friendships is
 priceless and I am grateful for the opportunity. Cisco Connect

&#x201C;Aside this, during my time with the Cisco Amsterdam office,
 Cisco employees participated in trainings and workshops and Nigerian Cisco
 female employees got a chance to be a part of the Cisco Connected Women&#x2019;s
 Amsterdam and the girls in ICT programmes, which train and educate girls on the
 roles and potential career paths present in Cisco Systems and the ICT industry
 as a whole. Cisco&#x2019;s commitment to championing women makes Cisco Connected
 Women&#x2019;s programme is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate diversity and
 inclusion in technology and business.&#x201D;

 reiterated its commitment to empowering women and increasing their
