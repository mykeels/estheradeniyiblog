Like y&#x2019;all now know, I am trying really hard to be holiday conscious. This is where you should clap for me o. Ehn. Thank you thank you thank you.

This post is inspired by one of my Blogger friends. She needed to make a blog post and she asked of our opinions on our favorite thing about Christmas.

My answer to her inspired me to make this into a full post. It may inspire you to write something about Christmas too.

So, what do I like most about Christmas?

 It&#x2019;s the harmattan.

I miss Ilorin. I miss the harmattan that comes with this Christmas season. I miss Ilorin, I miss Ilorin, I miss Ilorin. I really wish I can go back to that state, even if it is just for Christmas.

Yeaaaaaaah&#x2026;.. There is usually a very calm feeling when I smell and feel harmattan. It usually reminds me of past Christmases, no matter how non chalant I was towards them. There are fond memories.

The weather here is nothing like Christmas. It&#x2019;s so out of it. Why is it still raining here in Lagos? I am tayaaaaad.

I look forward to making more harmattan memories with my future nuclear family. I want to feel and smell the dry cold with them. I want to cherish the harshness on my body and the long time in bed. The thrill of cold bath water and the dryness of the bathroom floor.

In other news, I have a wish list for Christmas. This is just going to take a paragraph. I need a laptop, badly. It would make my Christmas superb. I can give out blog consulting services for free. I can design a blog for free. Whatever I have to do to own an efficient laptop, I am willing and ready to.

What is your favorite thing about Christmas?
