**Agbalumo** is one of the very many fruits we ate as kids. Yoruba people are the ones who call it Agbalumo. In Igbo, it is referred to as Udara. **The English name for Agbalumo** is African Star Apple. Its botanical or scientific name is Chrysophyllum africanum or Chrysophyllum albidum

As nostalgic as this bitter sweet fruit is, it is still a staple today if you have to get your mouth tasting something. I usually eat agbalumo whenever I feel like throwing up because of this strong, concentrated taste it leaves in my mouth afterwards.

If you are a good agbalumo picker, you will always pick the ripe ones. There are hints to picking ripe agbalumo tho&#x2019;. The ripe ones are usually soft and reddish on the top. You see those agbalumos that are green on the top? Run away from it!

## Agbalumo seed

**Agbalumo seed** was in those days commonly used to make earrings while we were young. We would break the black outer covering and then break the inner seed into two. We place each of the sides of the agbalumo on our ears. This seed also has a lot of health benefits as it is used to treat some skin diseases.

## Agbalumo tree

There is a very popular thing around **agbalumo tree**. I really don&#x2019;t know if it is just a folklore or myth. It is believed that the fruits are not supposed to be plucked directly from the tree as evil things might burst forth. This is not only in the Yoruba land, it is also held in Igbo land.

It is also believed that the agbalumo tree is owned by the community and that the fruits are supposed to be picked only when they have dropped.

## Agbalumo and pregnancy

Pregnant women have testified to how much agabalumo has helped them. This is because this fruit is a lot of fiber. It also helps to prevent preganant women from vomiting. Because of the general health benefits of the star apple fruit pregnant women can immensely benefit from it.&#xA0;It is however advised that pregnant women have to eat this fruit moderately because if consumed too much, it may have other harmful effects.
