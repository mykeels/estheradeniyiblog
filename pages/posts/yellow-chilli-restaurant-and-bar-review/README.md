## Where is Yellow Chilli located specifically in Lagos?

![Yellow Chilli Restaurant and bar](images\Yellow-Chilli-Restaurant-And-Bar.jpg)

I believe that part of enjoying the service of a company is knowing that the journey to get the service was hitch free and very comfortable.

Yellow Chilli is located at Ikeja in Lagos and their address is, 35 Joel Ogunnaike Street, Ikeja, Lagos. The road that leads to this restaurant/bar is in very good condition and bump free. So you are sure to have a very smooth ride from wherever you are coming from to Yellow Chilli, very stress-free.

## What types of food do they serve at Yellow Chilli Restaurant?

Yellow Chilli mainly serves out local, pan-African and Nigerian delicacies.

All of the cuisines available at Yellow Chilli are very ethnic and indigenous and debunk the popular misconception that indigenous dishes can only be gotten from nearby shanties.

## Yellow Chilli Menu

### Jollof rice

Their Jollof rice is a dish you must have when you go there. They are very popular for it, their Jollof is life-saving.

Also, they have the Seafood Okra which they are also super famous for! First-time visitors from all over the world always give this dish a try and give very positive reviews on it. It is not only appealing to the eyes but also appealing and delicious to the taste buds.

### Swallow

They have so many different indigenous soups for you to pair with whatever Swallow food you choose. Apart from Seafood Okra and Jollof Rice, they have the following;

&#x2014; Otong Soup, Bitter leaf soup, Okro soup, Ogbono soup, Egusi soup, Efo Riro Soup, Afang Soup, Afia Efere/and Nsala White soup and Edikang Ikong soup.

The above are the soups that they have in their food menu and of course, you can eat these soups with Pounded Yam, Semovita, Eba, Amala or White Rice. Sounds cool right?

Their soups are also very affordable and come at a discounted price if you are buying for more than one person. Their Efo Riro tastes amazing and it is one you will definitely always crave again and again. Also, their Jollof Rice doesn&#x2019;t just come bare, it comes with Diced Chicken, Unshelled prawns, Shrimps, and Pepper sauce!

It definitely tastes delicious and you can have all of these for just N3,800 only! For some heavenly tasting Jollof Rice, it is totally worth the cash! I mean, who doesn&#x2019;t love Jollof Rice?

### Fried Rice

Also, along with Jollof Rice, you can also have Fried Rice. Their Fried Rice also comes cooked with diced chicken, Shrimps and prawns just like the Jollof counterpart. The Friend Rice also goes for N3,800 only!

### Chef&#x2019;s Combo Platters

They also have a special dish called the Chef&#x2019;s Combo Platter. This is a dish of Diced Plantains or plantain slices! So, if you are a fan of Delicious and mouth-watering Plantain, here is something for you from Yellow Chilli!

The Fried Plantain dish called Chef&#x2019;s Combo comes with either Omelette, prawns or Snails!! The plantain slices are also spiced with tomato, onions, green pepper, Omelette or Efo Riro all according to your choice! This also goes for N3,800.

### Beans with Beef

You can also have Beans with Beef when you go to Yellow Chilli.

That is of course if you love beans. You can have a delicious pottage of Beans from them also with plantain pieces!

Also, if you don&#x2019;t want Beans with plantain, you can have it with assorted meat, cow leg, Shaking or Chicken! You can also pair the beans with Oxtail (Yes, they have it), Fresh Fish, Stock Fish, Dried Fish or Snail.

### White Rice

## Yellow Chilli Menu and Prices

Another thing one needs to look at is the price. Do the prices match the quality of the dish you are buying?

Is the restaurant unnecessarily billing you for a dish that costs half the price? You need to ask these questions if you want to choose a restaurant to eat or a restaurant to take your loved ones to for a lunch or dinner treat.

The happy thing about Yellow Chilli Restaurant and bar is that though their services and food are so high in quality and top notch, their prices are not overboard at all.

You can&#x2019;t find a dish in their menu that costs more than N4,500. As For the normal Nigerian soups, no soup in their menu costs more than N3,000 with all the assorted beefs, diced chicken and stuff that will stock the soup. They also don&#x2019;t charge for swallows once you buy a type of soup with it. Their swallows cost N0 whether it is Eba, Pounded Yam, Semo or Amala you want to eat with the soup. How cool right?

Yellow Chilli Restaurant is indeed a fantastic place for you and your loved ones to grab local dishes. It had impeccable standards and delicious meals! All for token amount! You will definitely love it there. Try them!
