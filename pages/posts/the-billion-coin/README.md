**The Billion coin** has come to gain popularity in Nigeria and the world since the recent economic recession. I still do not think that we have recovered fully from that, we are all just being politically correct about our stance.

## What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that involves the use of encryption and mathematical algorithm techniques to regulate the way currency is generated and verify the transfer of funds though the blockchain. Crypto currency has no central point and as such does not have any affiliation with banks or any other institutions that deal with physical cash.

## What is TBC or The Billion Coin?

**The Billion Coin (TBC) is a cryptocurrency** used to purchase goods and services. It is an internet currency based on digital systems and because the world is going digital in every respect, it looks as though this is really the future of money.

Just like bitcoin, The Billion Coin (TBC) is a decentralized crypto currency that depends on the growth of its community.

The value of TBC keeps on increasing everyday, it is said to never go down and this is because it is based on the number of newly verified numbers added to the system everydsy.

Say for example, you buy 100 TBC today, there is the assurance that after 1 year your 100 TBC is already worth 1 million Naira or even more than that. If you buy 1 TBC today, after 5 years it is already worth a million Naira or more.

The price of TBC officially changes by 1:00pm everyday.

Digital Currency (Crypto Currency) is fast taking over globally as a medium of payment.

&#x201C;TBC is a user&#x2019;s based currency that makes it called &#x201C;the first abundance&#xA0;based cryptocurrency&#x201D;. &#x201D; &#x2013; [Signalng](http://www.signalng.com/billion-coin-despite-economic-recession-people-still-getting-paid-read/)

## Is TBC a Scam?

There are a lot of claims on the internet as to how The Billion coin is a scam or to put it mildly, a ponzi scheme.

While I cannot for sure ascertain the authenticity of these claims, I can say that it is very important to start any internet transactions slowly.

A lot of people, out of greed, dive right into internet businesses with all of the resources they have.

What do you think of TBC? Have you ever invested in it? Is TBC a scam?
