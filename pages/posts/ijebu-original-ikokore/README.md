Ikokore is yam redefined. If you agree with me, say yay. Yeah, right. It&#x2019;s one of the Ijebu&#x2019;s favourites. It is simple to prepare. I don&#x2019;t know if to say it is easy because this recipe involves some yam grating. This is basically what people run away from, the grating. Other than that, it is easy.

&#xA0;

## Ingredients for Ikokore:

Water yam- 1 big size
 Smoked fish- 2 small sizes
 Crayfish (ground)- 3 tablespoons
 Tomatoes &#x2013; 1 medium size
 Seasoning &#x2013; 2 cubes
 Salt &#x2013; to taste
 Fresh pepper- 4 medium sizes
 Palm oil- 2 cooking spoons
 Onion &#x2013; 1 medium size
 Water

## How to prepare Ikokore

&#xA0;

Peel, wash and grate the water yam.

Blend the tomatoes, onions and pepper together.

Pour all the water into a pot , add the smoked fish, crayfish and blended pepper.

Allow to boil.

Add palm oil and the 2 cubes of seasoning.

Mix the grated water yam with a little salt and water if necessary.

Drop the mixture a bit at a time into the pot.

Cover the pot and cook for 15 minutes.

Stir and add salt if required.

There you go, &#xA0;Ikokore.
