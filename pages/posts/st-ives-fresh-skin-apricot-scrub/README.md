The first time I used a facial scrub, I was in 300Level and it was **St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub**. One of my friends had suggested I tried it when she saw my face. I moved on to use other facial scrubs as I moved on in life but always came back to St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub. It was like my default facial scrub.

So, I am not the kind of girl that has a lot of beauty products, I just do staples like the facial cleanser, facial scrub, body cream, body soap, you know and all of that. Nothing extravagant and complicated and that&#x2019;s because I have always been very particular about the long-term effect of skin care products.

My mum would warn us so sternly that all you want to use is Vaseline lol. And we used vaseline for a&#xA0;very long time, fam. You have no idea! When my parents sweet talk you into anything, you are gone.

**Fun, distracting fact**: Because she didn&#x2019;t want to get me an extra bag, she told me that wine colour basically goes with any other colour so I can use the bag with any outfit, any colour and just about anything. I was a fresh undergraduate Y&#x2019;all, I believed that until my exasperated roommate&#xA0;burst my mum&#x2019;s bubble.

Long story short, because I have stuck with&#xA0;St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub for this long, I think a review is in order. I will try as much as possible (like I always do, you should give me a million thumbs up fam) to mention everything you need to know to make a purchase decision (to buy or not). I will talk about how to use&#xA0;St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, how much it costs in Nigeria at the moment, how often you should use&#xA0;St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, the before and after feeling of&#xA0;St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub and as many other things about the facial scrub as I can remember.

## Why should you use a facial scrub?

People exfoliate their skins with different methods. Some people do physical exfoliation. Physical exfoliation is mostly mechanical. You use exfoliating brushes to manually exfoliate. Chemical exfoliation or scrubbing as hasher as it sounds is actually a milder, softer form of facial scrubbing.

In this case, you don&#x2019;t have to [exert too much of pressure on your skin to get your exfoliation to begin](https://estheradeniyi.com/best-tips-to-exfoliating-your-face/). With the ingredients in the facial scrub, you are at a double advantage of using chemicals and the physical action of coarse granules.

Every day, we have dead skin cells accumulate, dirt and facial oil on our skin surface. Skin cleansers are not enough to get rid of this accumulation effectively. This is why a facial scrub is necessary for deep scrubbing to reveal fresh, new skin.

## How to use&#xA0;**St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot**

1. Try to get your skin damp first by applying some water all over your face. Try to make sure that your hands are clean to avoid transferring dirt and germs unto your skin surface.

2. Squeeze a little amount of Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub into your fingertips and gently massage into your damp skin in circular motions. You can apply some pressure to make the granules rub well into your skin. Be careful not to scrub too hard to avoid physical irritation.

3. When you are done rubbing this in all over your face, wash off with clean water.

4. Pat your facial skin with a clean towel. I usually try to pat my skin rather than rub dry.

## How often should you use&#xA0;St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub?

Ideally, you should not use any facial scrub more than 3 times a week. When I first started to use facial scrubs, I used to use it too regularly. It made my skin really tight and I began to break out after a while. After reading the internet, facial scrub reviews and how often one should use St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, I established a better routine for it.

## Why I like St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub

St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub is such a good facial scrub because it exfoliates the skin well without making it dry out or flake. It leaves my skin very well moisturized and smooth. Some of the reasons why I couldn&#x2019;t cope with the other facial scrubs was because of the way they dried out my skin after use. With just one use St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub also made it look like it was enough for the week. With this facial scrub, [I have had it easy to pull off the all-natural look](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-pull-off-all-natural-look/).

## What I don&#x2019;t like about St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub

On two occasions, I have had the packaging break right from the store. I did not know until I got home. The packaging even though looks firm enough, seems to be a little bit fragile. I would suggest that you try to check the packaging very well before you buy.
