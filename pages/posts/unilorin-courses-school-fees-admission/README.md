**In this article: Unilorin courses, Unilorin school fees, Unilorin admission requirements, why Unilorin is one of the most****sought-after university in Nigeria, undergraduate and postgraduate portal.**

**University of Ilorin** is that one place I remember so fondly. I miss **Unilorin** days so bad. From the customary shunting to the [hostel accommodation](https://estheradeniyi.com/before-you-pay-for-that-hostel-bed/)&#xA0;to my classmates, oh my classmates. I think your classmates are the ones who make it fun for you. Many people believe that Ilorin as a town is very dry and so you need to create fun all by yourself. You have everything you need, just create the fun.

I do not entirely disagree because there were days in school when we just wanted to create some buzz and fun like we would in Lagos. Nothing much though, we just wanted to be able to choose from a wide variety of places like we have in Lagos but alas [fun places in Ilorin](https://estheradeniyi.com/fun-places-to-visit-in-ilorin/) are kind of limited.

Nevertheless, the school was fun still, for me. The [University of Ilorin](https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/) has its own perks like other schools. I mean, people who finished from other universities had something to say about theirs too. I had so many secondary school mates mocked me, they would go on about how much of a secondary school Unilorin is. Hey, thank you, I love Unilorin like that.

I would jokingly respond that only jealous people spoke the way they did. **Unilorin is better by far**, no disputing. Why would the whole nation constantly apply for University as first choice if there wasn&#x2019;t something to look forward to? Anyway, that&#x2019;s rhetorical tho&#x2019;, the answer is pinpoint clear already, lol.

Surprising is that I did not start being a Unilorin fanatic before I gained admission. It was way after I became a Unilorin student. How else would you describe someone who did both her Undergraduate and Masters degree in the same tertiary institution? When it&#x2019;s not like Federal universities have finished in Nigeria.

## How I got admission into University of Ilorin

Let me give you a brief history of **how I got admission into University of Ilorin**. I have always wanted to make this into a separate blog post but I guess, this is the best time to talk about it.

So I had applied to Unilorin and met the cut off mark for both Post Jamb (it was Jamb and not Utme then) and Jamb. I was denied my first admission because I was using awaiting result.

Unfortunately for me, my parents and I had been brainwashed. Some ignorant person had convinced me to pick University** of Ilorin** as my first and second choice because that was going to increase my chances of gaining admission. Guys, I am the first born. You know how life trials and errors start and end with you.

Chai, it&#x2019;s you that will step into territories none of their children has ever stepped into. If you are also the firstborn of your family, let&#x2019;s gather round in the comments section for a selfie. It was a learning curve for both of my parents and I. So, for some reason, we were allowed to brainwashed.

I lost out on that. Tried a second time and I met all of the admission requirements again. Somehow I didn&#x2019;t see my name on the first admission list again, gosh.

I was devastated, to say the least. I gave up and began to wait for OAU&#x2019;s admission list. While waiting, a call came through. The result of the call was what we called **Bonanza Admission**. If you were admitted in 2009, you would understand this. It was first and last of its kind.

The school authority had put the information up on the website and asked that people who met all Unilorin&#x2019;s admission requirements and didn&#x2019;t make it to the admission list to come down to Unilorin. Guys, I was no more checking through the website.

A kind soul of a woman reached out to my parents on a Sunday morning. By Monday afternoon, I was already in front of the admission office. Long story short, I got admitted to study Chemistry.

## Why is University of Ilorin, Unilorin, one of the most sought-after Universities in Nigeria?
[![](images\Now-Enrolling.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/leeroymontessori/)ADMISSION IN PROGRESS. CLICK TO ENROLL!
Why is University of Ilorin so different, so unique?

### 1. University of Ilorin never goes on strikes

Except for the labour strike that was declared a long time ago, when I was in school, I cannot clearly remember a time we went on unnecessary, sick strikes. It is claimed that Unilorin has not gone on strike since 2001. I don&#x2019;t know how true it is but I bet that if it is not far gone, it is way reasonable.

### 2. Unilorin school fees are fair

Some government-owned tertiary institutions still go as far as charging ridiculous fees from students. You would be surprised how much students still have to pay in some government-owned institutions.

### 3. Unilorin has gone popular

Perhaps, University of Ilorin&#x2019;s popularity is due to the no-strike in many years attribute. Who would not want to graduate from the University in due time? By the time I was done with [my masters in the University of Ilorin](https://estheradeniyi.com/is-masters-degree-really-worth-i/), some of my mates were just finishing undergraduate studies, funny.

In 2017, Unilorin had the highest applications with 104, 038 students applying to study in Unilorin, out of the total overall of 1,212,818 total [applicants seeking admissions](https://estheradeniyi.com/how-to-check-unilorin-20172018/) into all the 40 Federal Universities that we have in Nigeria.

### 4. Educational corruption is minimal

I don&#x2019;t know if educational corruption is the right grammar to use here but I think you already know what I am talking about. I used to hear stories of how a lecturer would collect huge sums of money from University students and how corrupt some lecturers are in other tertiary institutions.

I do not mean to say that Unilorin does not have its own fair share of corrupt lecturers but this is not something you hear about every corner you turn to. Some tertiary institutions in Nigeria boldly turn a blind eye to corrupt, dubious and lazy lecturers. This is not the same for University of Ilorin.

### 5. Many facilities are modern

So, it&#x2019;s like this: anytime any of my alumni friends go to school they always talk about how there is a new building around the block. Something is constantly being built in University of Ilorin and I guess this is some sort of accolades for this institution. There is always structural and infrastructural developments going on in school.
