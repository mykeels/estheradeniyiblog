Most of us would like to change at least one thing about our bodies. Of course, there are some things we can&#x2019;t change, but there are many that we can if we are disciplined enough.

Still, it&#x2019;s important to note that our true beauty comes from within but it doesn&#x2019;t mean we should neglect our bodies.

We should all be striving to be healthy and have a healthy weight, so if you are determined to achieve your dream body, there are some important steps you&#x2019;ll have to make first.

## Healthy diet

You can&#x2019;t have a great body for a long time if you don&#x2019;t change your dieting habits. And you first need to identify what you actually eat throughout the day. So, the best solution is to write down everything you eat for a week or two. When you take a look at your meals, you will realize what changes you should make. Sometimes cutting out sugary foods will be the only change and sometimes drastic steps will have to be taken.

For most people, a balanced diet is the safest way. In other words, there should be a balance between proteins, carbs, and fat. You can try with a diet where you will eat 40% carbs, 30% proteins and 30% fat and pay attention to what happens in the next month or two. If you introduce even the slightest change, make sure you note it. That way, you&#x2019;ll be really good at knowing how your body reacts to a certain diet.

Next, never skip your meals and then eat when you&#x2019;re starving. You&#x2019;ll eat too much then. The other problem is that, when you starve your body, it thinks there is a famine coming, so next time you eat, it will store more fat than usual. It&#x2019;s better to have between 4 and 6 meals a day, as it will increase your metabolism. The important thing is to [eat slowly](https://www.wikihow.com/Eat-Slowly) so that you know in time when you&#x2019;re full. Never eat past that point.

Lastly, [drink a lot of water](https://estheradeniyi.com/5-ways-i-trick-myself-to-drink-more-water/). It helps our bodies get rid of the toxins, speeds up the metabolism and improves digestion. Drink between 2 and 3 liters water a day. If you find plain water dull, add lemon juice, cucumber or ginger.

## Get active

Being active means a lot of things. Of course, it&#x2019;s about getting regular exercise but it also means much more than that. You won&#x2019;t get headway if you do exercises twice or three times a week, but you spend the rest of your time sitting at your office desk and lying in front of the TV. You should lead a more active life in general.

First of all, let&#x2019;s make it clear why regular workout is important. If you have excess weight, it won&#x2019;t just go away if you change your diet. Your body needs to burn more calories than usual, which means you&#x2019;ll have to sweat at the gym or in a yoga class. Of course, if obesity is causing you serious troubles that prevent you from being active, then consider a medical procedure to remove the excess weight quickly and make it easier on your body. You can inform yourself about weight loss procedures on reliable sites like [Central Coast Surgery](https://www.centralcoastsurgery.com.au/) to find out what the alternatives are.

Secondly, a regular workout will shape your body in the right way. As you will lose more weight, you need to make sure you don&#x2019;t get loose skin. That&#x2019;s where weight training can help. It will highlight your best features and help you build strength.

Thirdly, you should take any chance you can to be active. That means going for a long walk in the evening before bed instead of watching TV. It means going to the park at the weekend with friends or family, play team sports, cycle to work instead of driving a car. In other words, choosing active life over a passive one.

## Get enough rest

This may come as surprise, but rest is equally important as exercise. Many people think that rest is a waste of time or they think that it&#x2019;s ok to get only 5 or 6 hours of sleep every day. Big mistake. When we sleep, our body heals itself and gets refreshed. If you deprive yourself of sleep, you will feel exhausted and cranky most of the time.

Consequently, you will be in a bad mood, worried and even depressed, which will make you eat more and eat unhealthy foods. [Not enough sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/10-results-sleep-loss) also slows down your metabolism and doesn&#x2019;t allow your body to process food properly. Not to mention consequences to your health it could cause, including issues with your cardiovascular system.

## Final comment

In short, achieving your dream body will be a result of various factors. A healthy diet, an active life, and adequate sleep are the right answers. When combined, they will definitely make your dream come true.
