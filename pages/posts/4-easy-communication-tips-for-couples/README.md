A relationship is the coming together of two emotional people. For them to be able to stay together, they need good communication skills.

Good communication is an important part of all relationships, platonic or emotional. It can either make or break a relationship. All relationships have their ups and down but good communication can make it a lot easier.

You can improve your relationship by putting into practice some of these tips:

1. For [good communication,](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lifetime-connections/201605/10-steps-effective-couples-communication) you need to be open with your partner; you have to be honest. You should be able to confide in your partner, do not hide your emotions, feel comfortable to discuss anything.&#x201D;When you feel it, say it&#x201D;. Always say it like it is even when you know it will hurt your significant other.

To be open in a relationship means dicussing things that you are not comfortable with or things that make you vulnerable. Also when you tell a lie, you have to always cover it up with a bigger lie, so honesty is key.

2. Always resolve conflicts in a healthy way because discussions at times can turn into argument. Do not say hurtful things to one another, try as much as possible to cool off instead of yelling because you want to be heard.You might end up not passing any message, so always take a step back and listen.

4. Make it an habit of not going to bed angry with your partner. Talk about your issues or fight before settling in for the night so as to wake up in the morning with a fresh start. It is another beautiful new day, so enjoy the day knowing your partner loves you. There is nothing more beautiful like a good lovemaking session and a breakfast in bed.
