Sometimes life throws some situations at you that make you question your values. You ask yourself if it&#x2019;s even worth it to be a good person in this world at all. You&#x2019;ve been in that type of situation right? A scenario where you are faced with a particular difficulty and a quick solution to the problem is to just switch to bad-girl mode, transfer your annoyance to those around and you know, just spoil things.

Maybe your &#x201C;bestest&#x201D; friend in the whole world lied against you to your face ( Ouch, that must really hurt in real life&#x2026; Thank God it&#x2019;s only an example) and this friend had always called herself your closest friend in the entire world. And you&#x2019;re like, &#x201C;Hey Girl! You&#x2019;re not the only one that can be bad, ya know? Everyone&#x2019;s got their own craze!&#x201D; And you just want to flip out your bad girl card and shove it in her face. Like there, feel it! I got craze too..

Really, that would be most women&#x2019;s reaction. At least &#x201C;most&#x201D;. Especially here in Nigeria where we don&#x2019;t like to take rubbish, at least we claim not to. Or what would you do in that friendship crisis? Hmm?

I noticed something in this[life](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/stop-comparing-your-life-with-others?m=1). Ask me what it is? You get the CHOICE TO CHOOSE YOUR REACTION when someone treats you poorly. Yeah.. So it&#x2019;s totally dependent on you maybe you give a aggressive reaction or keep your cool and react like the wise babe that you are. I mean, you don&#x2019;t &#x201C;slay&#x201D; for nothing. Or do you? There&#x2019;s got to be a lot of intelligence rolling along with all the &#x201C;slaying&#x201D; right? Yeah.

So, you can choose to be a totally good person in this world even when the world around you keeps saying otherwise. There&#x2019;s more to life than letting someone get to you. They don&#x2019;t have the power to change you from good to bad. That&#x2019;s your choice to say. If we were all good in this world, this world would be a much, much better place. Being GOOD is a really precious and important virtue, even though it&#x2019;s importance is highly underestimated in our world. The little Goodness left in this world is the reason HUMANITY still exists. Really&#x2026; Or else, we&#x2019;ll have finished each other off.

So, how do you stay [motivated](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/stop-comparing-your-life-with-others?m=1)in a situation threatening your KINDNESS STANCE. How do you ensure you don&#x2019;t let life change that good heart into something very bad.. Well, I figured quotes should help. Not just quotes, powerful, thought provoking, inspiring and strong quotes to help you take your stand.

Below are 20 of them;

20. By polluting clear water with slime, you will never find good drinking water.

So! There they are. Which one did you love most? My favorite should be number 16. Partly because I love Alicia Keys and partly because that quote radiates TRUTH mehn!

So, all in all, try to be the best version of you possible. Help save the world. Do your part in goodness. IT. IS. WORTH. IT.
