I have so much to say that I don&#x2019;t exactly know where to start from. This isn&#x2019;t even as bizarre as the fact that I don&#x2019;t know how my 1000th blog post should go.

This can only happen once, reaching 1000. I understand that there are so many blog metrics and while this doesn&#x2019;t seem like the popular one every solo Blogger measures, I am left to figure out how to work this.

So, here goes:

## Gratitude

For every single one of you who has ever visited my blog, I am grateful. You have no idea what this means to me. I am excited to have you in my life and on this journey.

Your comments mean so much to me. Your emails, gosh, they lift me up. I am excited to do all of this with you. It&#x2019;s all of the push any Blogger needs because, in reality, it is absolutely pointless to have a blog with no readers.

So, really, this blog exists because of you!

## My blogging journey

If I knew this was going to be as serious as this, I would have prepared better, only that it may never be as exciting as this has been. Haven&#x2019;t you noticed how the need to be perfect destroys the whole process?

This all started with a post. Look where we are.

Blogging has been very life-changing for me. This beautiful platform has taught me consistency, dedication, integrity. I mean, I have had ups and downs and learned from them all.

Every Blogger, serious Blogger, would tell you that they too are undergoing life-changing experiences building and managing a blog. This teaches you life itself. Personal development is on another level as you cannot give what you don&#x2019;t have.

## Becoming a full-time Blogger&#x2026;

There&#x2019;s still very much to say in this regard and even though it makes no sense to me at all, I am still saving this story for someday but tarry with me, will you?&#xA0;

Going full time has been one of the best decisions ever, you should know. It is just like any other kind of entrepreneurship you can think of, only that this is online and very new. I mean, resources are still unfolding, there is no clear road map for this. We are all figuring this on our own, by ourselves.&#xA0;

What&#x2019;s important is that we are making it work nevertheless. The bumps are our crossroads and overcoming them is yet another badge of progress.&#xA0;

## Going forward

Nothing spectacularly different. I just want to keep learning and sharing. I want to savour as much as I am able to out of life and give it all a meaning. I want to write as much as my ink can carry and make the best use of my time on earth while exploring and deploying all of my potentials to full capacity.&#xA0;

I am also grabbing every single opportunity for growth and development. Any chance this blog gets to be pushed to the next level, I am taking it and squeezing the life out of it.&#xA0;

I am preparing to add more spice to my content and bring some life into the categories on the blog. I hope that I am able to get you to stay glued to what this new exciting journey has to offer.&#xA0;

## Xoxo&#x2026;

I really do love the safe space you have given me to express and inform at the same time. This does not happen every time and if you must know, I pray for you. This is blatant truth! I am unapologetically unashamed to say that your very move to click on anything in here completes me. You have this much hold on me.&#xA0;

So, cheers to 1000!
