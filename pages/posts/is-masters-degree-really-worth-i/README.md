 Should I pursue a grad course in my field? Is a masters degree really worth the hype? What are the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing a masters degree? &#xA0;Should I go for my masters degree now or later? Is it really worth the financial investment?

If you never cared to ask these questions in your first year of undergraduate school, you&#x2019;ll be forced to as soon as you are rounding off in final year. I remember how indifferent I was towards this subject. I didn&#x2019;t even get to make up my mind until my service year was almost over. Getting a masters degree wasn&#x2019;t a do-or-die affair for me. If it was the next thing on the plate, then bring it on.

Many people are either like I was during my undergrad (indifferent) or at a crossroad (about to make a choice). Whichever way it is, I have compiled a list of pros and cons to help you decide if getting a masters degree is worth it. I have made this article into a mini-guide for people who are finding it hard to make a decision already. Truth is, it&#x2019;s supposed to be a very important decision as you may find yourself making a very terrible mistake especially in your financial life. Getting a masters degree might not cost a fortune but it&#x2019;s definitely going to dig a significant hole in your pocket.

Pros

You Learn More About a Subject You Love

For many reasons, we have seen many people develop enviable interest in their undergraduate course of study. It&#x2019;s amazing how much you want to know about something that you love to read about, study about and talk about. A masters degree is a good life choice to help you accomplish getting more knowledge.

You Become More Respected in Your Field

Many people don&#x2019;t want to hear this but it&#x2019;s very true. We live in a world where your qualification may have to go before a chance to prove your worth. A masters degree owner is definitely more respected than a B. Sc owner, for example. This is not to downplay any degree of course but this is just the way it is.

Your Intellect is Sharpened

There is something books do to you, &#xA0;they sharpen your Intelligence Quotient. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if they are books on wisdom, or understanding. Reasoning and solving problems on a higher scale helps you increase your intellectual prowess and heighten your problem solving skills. I definitely finished my masters degree more intelligent than I was before. My emotional intelligence also increased as I learnt how to survive so many ups and downs we face as grad students especially during research.

You Have More Job Opportunities

I don&#x2019;t need to stress this more than you already know. Having a masters degree puts you over many others who have just an undergrad degree when you are job hunting. In fact, &#xA0;it adds to your confidence as prospective employers would love to employ (all things equal) someone with a masters degree than someone who doesn&#x2019;t have one.

Cons

It Can be Financially Draining

Some people start a masters degree without critically assessing the cost of completely finishing one. I have seen a few people drop out of the program because they sadly got what they didn&#x2019;t bargain for. It&#x2019;s not better if you are especially in the science field. Research work can be so expensive. In fact, &#xA0;more expensive than the school fees. Without appropriate funding, you might end up skipping meals to complete a masters degree.

Some Fields Don&#x2019;t Require Getting a Masters Degree

You wouldn&#x2019;t pursue getting a masters degree in a rush if you studied medicine or some other professional courses. Of course, a masters degree is a good one but is it really worth it? For some other career options, you may only need to have a sound undergrad degree to forge ahead in your career path. &#x201C;For example, those interested in careers in public relations, journalism, human resources or video game design may not need a master&#x2019;s degree unless they are interested in management or research in those fields. Applying for an entry-level job in such fields with a master&#x2019;s degree could hurt their chances.&#x201D;- [Maria Magher](https://draft.blogger.com/(http://classroom.synonym.com/advantages-disadvantages-pursuing-masters-degree-9954.html) says.

It May be a Waste of Time

You spend at least 12 months to barge a masters degree in many schools. Realistically, it&#x2019;s usually more than that ; approximately two years. It can be a terrible waste of time going to study more in a field than starting up a career immediately. There is something as being overqualified for a job. Why waste time getting overqualified?

So here are the options you can weigh in finally deciding whether to pursue a masters degree or not. There are as many advantages as there are disadvantages of getting a masters degree but carefully assessing your options and determining what&#x2019;s best for you will definitely help in making a decision.
