 &#x201C;Musujusu, who is a native of Sierra-Leone, disclosed that her research focuses on the aggressive sub-type of chest cancer which is common in African women, triple negative chest cancer; but the research might lead to a lasting solution in the treatment of chest cancer for women all around the world.&#x201D;- [Information Nigeria](https://www.informationng.com/2017/07/new-treatment-breast-cancer-discovered-female-nigerian-student.html)

 Musujusu stated: &#x201C;My research is actually centered on the development of bio-degradable polymers for treatment of chest cancer.

 &#x201C;I will be focusing on triple negative chest cancer which is actually the aggressive sub-type of chest cancer that is common with women from African ancestry.

 &#x201C;I believe there is a bright future for Africa, and as a woman there is much more we can do if we are empowered.

 &#x201C;This award given to me by PAMI has empowered me to face my studies with more confidence and actually contribute to the frontier of knowledge and move Africa forward.&#x201D;

 According to WHO, cancer accounts for 13 percent of all deaths registered globally and 70 percent of that figure occurs in middle and low income countries.

 In Nigeria, about 10,000 cancer deaths are recorded annually while 250,000 new cases are recorded yearly.
