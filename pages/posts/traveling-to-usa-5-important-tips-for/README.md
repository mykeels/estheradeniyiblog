It&#x2019;s that time of the year again and a lot
 of people are beginning to plan for the holidays. It is going to be another
 beautiful time to dispel the stress, the work burn outs and all of the things
 that get us working round the clock. Beautiful, isn&#x2019;t it?

This is probably the first time you will be
 traveling to USA; little wonder this blog title ticks all your fancy checklist.
 This blog post (in collaboration with [TravelStart](https://www.travelstart.com.ng/)) is also going to be
 resourceful even if you aren&#x2019;t traveling to USA for the first time.

There are a number of things you should
 take care of before embarking on your trip, an international one as that. In
 fact, the stylish Nigerian woman is&#xA0;thoroughly equipped so that she doesn&#x2019;t
 have panics and regrets. You are going to be making this trip in style, having
 tips to ease you and make this happen is definitely worth it.

Here are 5 important tips for you if you
 are traveling to USA this season:

1.
 Have a handy pack in your hand bag 

Many unforeseen things might happen during
 international trips. You might not be able to get your bags as soon as you want
 them, they might even become missing, anything. It is always advisable to have
 your handy pack contain a toothbrush, a dry sponge, extra clothes that can be
 folded into very small sizes, baby wipes and a sanitary pad. You don&#x2019;t want to
 spend the first few hours in USA looking for where to get a sanitary pad. Not
 only is having things not work out well destabilizing, it can affect the
 entirety of your vacation.

2.
 Be comfortable 

You will be spending approximately 13- 14
 hours on your flight to USA from Nigeria so get comfortable in the most stylish
 way you can. You want to take pictures, yes. You can be comfortable still.
 Don&#x2019;t go for anything too tight or oversized enough to get you unnecessarily self-conscious.
 If you must go for heels, get the shortest you can walk fast in if you have to.
 Otherwise, flats and sandals are the best.

3.
 Be sure to have worn your travel shoes at least once

It&#x2019;s okay to want to travel all new, there
 is an aura of confidence you exude when you are coming in &#x2018;brand new&#x2019;. You
 however should be free enough to walk well. Foot wears can be ridiculously
 unpredictable. The stylish Nigerian woman is prepared. Make sure you have worn
 it at least once to be able to vouch that it won&#x2019;t cause discomfort in your
 feet after a while.

4.
 Tuck your expensive jewelry safely until you are settled in 

You don&#x2019;t want a mess at the airport. You
 can never tell who is capable of stripping off your precious jewelry. You are
 in transit; you don&#x2019;t want to worry about all of that. This goes for expensive
 earrings, wristwatches, hand bands and even hair accessories. Be as simple as
 you can. You really can be simple and chic.

5.
 Plan your travel to USA very early 

Last minute rush, late flight bookings etc.
 can get you into panic and even cause you to overshoot your travel expense. A
 stylish woman is prepared; she never has to be taken unawares because she left
 some important detail unchecked.&#xA0;You can even find [cheap flights to USA](http://www.travelstart.com.ng/lp/usa/flights) with
[Travelstart](https://www.travelstart.com.ng/)&#xA0; if you have planned yourself
 way ahead of time. You don&#x2019;t have to
get into rush season.

Try to get things you will need way ahead
 of time too. A power bank for example will help you keep your phone charged.
 Having to look for where to charge your phone as soon as you get to USA can be
 challenging, stressful too.

Here you go, 5 important tips for you to
 make your traveling to USA one of the best experiences ever. Do you have any
 other tips? You&#x2019;ve had your vacation in USA and think you have other relevant
