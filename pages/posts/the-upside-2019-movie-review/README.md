Comedy, inspiration and mushy mushy don&#x2019;t always happen but it was a pleasant combo with **The Upside** and that is why in this movie review, I am going to be sharing some of my lessons and my favorite quotes from the movie.

With **Kevin Hart**, there was never a dull moment. There is actually never a dull moment with him. Did anyone see [Night School](https://estheradeniyi.com/night-school-2018/)?

So, The Upside is not like those of my movie impulses. I had seen the movie trailer on Film House Cinema&#x2019;s Instagram account and it was dope. Moreso because it is a true life story. I like stories of people being adapted into movies.

I will try as much as possible to not be a movie spoiler because it seems to me like this movie review is going to be detailed somewhat.

## The Upside Film Synopsis

**Dell (Kevin Hart)** is a parolee who is struggling to make ends meet while trying to get back together with his son and his mother. In a job hunting exercise, he walks into a caretaker job. His employee, **Phillip (Bryan Cranston)**, is a rich and hopeless quadriplegic.

## What I think of The Upside

![The Upside Movie](images\The-Upside-Movie.jpg)

That was a hell of a funny movie. Shocking is how low the rating of The Upside is on many of the [movie critic sites](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-upside) but you know where I get to look away? Google Users rating. If it&#x2019;s more than 70%, I go for it. And to think that 92% of Google users loved The Upside? To hell with the other reviews yo. Some of them are just too technically critiquing for my liking.

So, the opening scene was so typical of Kevin Hart! My ribs began to crack from right on the beginning of The Upside. It is such a hearty movie that will bring and invoke a lot of emotions.

I enjoyed the story, the acting and all of the twists. I cannot begin to mention how many new words, terms, and concepts I learned from watching The Upside.

Some of which I will not forget are:

- epistolary relationship
- quadriplegic
- lateral thinking

## Favorite Movie Quotes From The Upside

![the upside movie scenes](images\the-upside-movie-3.jpg)

Some of my favorite quotes are not too deep yo. They are just very funny. Oh well, some, a reason to think about your life, aha.

Because I was so prepared to take The Upside all in, I went to the cinema with my notepad open and I must say that I had so much fun watching it.

&#x201D; &#x2018;Tell me the last time you worked hard to get a job done.&#x2019;

&#x2018;This morning, getting up&#x2019; &#x201D;

&#x201D; &#x2018;Have you ever taken care of anybody?&#x2019;

&#x2018; Yes, myself&#x2019; &#x201D;

&#x201D; &#x2018; Are you richer than JayZ?&#x2019;

&#x2018;No, richer. Money doesn&#x2019;t buy you everything.&#x2019; &#x201D;

&#x201C;I specialize in turning around companies. Investing in startups.&#x201D;

&#x201C;How do you put a value on creative work. You pay to show it has value.&#x201D;

&#x201C;In the storm, lighting, what should we do? I know, paragliding&#x201D;

&#x201C;I swear, my son is never going to prison. No, too smart&#x201D;

&#x201C;How about this lady with botox, you are perfect for each other. You can&#x2019;t move her body, she can&#x2019;t move her face.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Everybody is a poet.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Smart women care about what&#x2019;s up in here(head) and here (heart).&#x201D;

&#x201C;The important thing is to see and encourage potential&#x201D;

&#x201C;You know that&#x2019;s my past and am&#x2019;ma own it. I am moving forward, are you?&#x201D;

&#x201C;People make mistakes&#x201D;

&#x201C;I know about his past, I am interested in his present&#x201D;

## Lessons From The Upside

![Kevin Hart in The Upside](images\Kevin-Hart-The-Upside.jpg)

**1. Optimism is the fuel of life**

Life is hard you know, if you are going to survive and most especially, thrive, you need to look at it with so much optimism that pessimism&#x2019;s got nothing on you.

**2. Favour is never explainable**

Sorry I have to go all spiritual on you here but you see favour isn&#x2019;t something you always have an explanation for. If you are going to be highly favoured of God and he decides that it is your time, he is going to cause men to stand for you and not against you.

Dell wasn&#x2019;t supposed to get that job. I know that Phillip had a hidden agenda but really, that&#x2019;s all favour working together to get Dell a better life.

3. Our worst nightmares could turn out to be a blessing

4. A man loses his respect if he can&#x2019;t provide

5. Your father&#x2019;s bad choices are not enough for you to give up on life, pick yourself up and run your own race.
