## Wonderful Love by Ccioma Lyrics

Ccioma: You can sway in your sit or you can stand you know
 No pressure
 But I just need you to enjoy the love of God
 eeeeeeeeh eheehhhhhhhhh

Ccioma: Your love is so wonderful
 Your love is so wonderful
 So high, I can&#x2019;t get over it
 So low, I can&#x2019;t get under it
 So wide, I can&#x2019;t get around it
 Jesus you give me wonderful love

Eeeeeeh eheeeeh eeeeeeh
 You give me wonderful love

All: Your love is so wonderful
 Your love is so wonderful
 So high, I can&#x2019;t get over it
 So low, I can&#x2019;t get under it
 So wide, I can&#x2019;t get around it
 Jesus you give me wonderful love

Celebrate your saviour
 We celebrate your love

All: Your love is so wonderful
 Your love is so wonderful
 So high, I can&#x2019;t get over it
 So low, I can&#x2019;t get under it
 So wide, I can&#x2019;t get around it
 Jesus you give me wonderful love

Ohhhhhhh ooooooohhhh

All: Your love is so wonderful
 Your love is so wonderful
 So high, I can&#x2019;t get over it
