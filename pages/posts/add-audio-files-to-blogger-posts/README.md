People have asked me in times past how to **add audio files to their posts in Blogger.** You might have music to share with your blog readers and you want them to be able to download it right there on your blog, [without having to go visit another blog](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-to-make-people-fall-hopelessly-in). Your blog might even be a music blog, dang.

Well,&#xA0; this is one of the downsides of using this blogging platform. Some things are not as automatic as they should be.&#xA0; In WordPress, all you have to do is to download a plugin. It&#x2019;s not so with Blogger. In fact, you need a third party to host your audio files.

## So, how do you add audio /music files to your posts on Blogger?

You can use many hosts to create and store the audio file from which you can recall with a link. In this blog post, I am going to show you how to use just one of them- Google Site.

&#xA0;

### Step 1: Create a Google Site

Remember I said that you would need a third party/external host to host your audio file. In this case, you need Google site. If you don&#x2019;t have a gmail account, here is where you have to register. Who doesn&#x2019;t have a gmail account though?

Go to [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/) and sign in with your Gmail address and your password.

When you are in, you will find a Create button on the top-left corner of the page, click on it, give your site a title and then select a template. You can write any name on the site title and pick the blank template. Select the &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a Robot.&#x201D; option and go to the Create button on top to click.

&#xA0;

### Step 2 : Upload your audio/video file on the created Google site

Create a File cabinet. Click on &#x201C;Create New Page&#x201D;. Give the page a title and from the &#x201C;select a template to use&#x201D; option, pick &#x201C;File Cabinet&#x201D;.

[![](images\webpage.png)](images\webpage.png)

On that same page, click on &#x201C;Add files&#x201D;. The icon is at the top right corner. It is the one with a folder with a plus sign .That will bring you to pick your audio/video file from where it is stored on your system. Click and upload.

It will take a while depending on how large the file is.

Afterwards, select &#x201C;On-Public on the Web&#x201D; and Click on Save button. To select the audio file, right click on download button, select Copy Link Location/Address or Copy link Address (depends on your browser).

&#xA0;

### Step 3: How to add the audio file to your Blogger post

Go to your blogger dashboard and create a new post there as usual.

You can do it in either of two ways:

i. Highlight the link you want to be the anchor text of the audio/video file and then insert the copied Google site URL.

ii. You can go to the html part of your text editor and paste this

<audio controls>

<source src=&#x201D;Your-Copied-Google-Site-URL-Here&#x201D; />

Replace Your-Copied-Google-Site-URL-Here with the link of audio file from your Google site.
 And you are done. Publish your post.

Please let me know if you encounter any problems.&#xA0; Share this with your Blogger friends too. [You can find other blogging hacks and tips here.](https://estheradeniyi.com/category/blogging-resources/)
