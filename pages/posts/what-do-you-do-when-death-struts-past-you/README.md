It was a flummoxed cow on the run. They were going to drive it to oblivion and it let loose. Who sticks around to watch their death anyway?

At first, it was nothing but as it charged faster, I knew that my life depended on how fast my legs could carry me.

I had sprained my knee during my workout and it was the most painful in a while. All I wanted to do was go home.

But my village people are crazy lots. They are not calm. In a split, I was on the loose myself.

TJ made it all worse with the tales of cows killing people. So, no chicken and chips for me anymore? I was going to watch The Angry Birds 2 by noon, that wasn&#x2019;t going to happen too?

I still haven&#x2019;t let fake lashes stay on for more than a day. What about my wedding? What if God dropped Mr Beautiful this evening?

I won&#x2019;t have a wedding night? I want to twirl more. I want to swim before I die. Yikes!

What would be the inscription on my grave yard? What would be on my obituary?

GONE TOO SOON, KILLED BY A COW.

You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding!

I am appeased by the fact that I had people whose support made a whole lotta difference. When your trainers have slowed down pace to be sure you are covered. A cow is at your back man. Who cares that hard though? Who waits to cover a trainee?

TJ and I ran into a shop and for a moment, that was the safest place in the world. Quick bursts of air from my lungs made me wheeze. The whole time, I was out of my body.
