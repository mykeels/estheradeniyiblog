[The Experience 2018 is here](http://theexperiencelagos.com/2018/) and this is the 13th edition. This year&#x2019;s edition is set to headline renowned gospel artists from all over the world.

The Experience concert is an annual concert that is held in House on the Rock church and hosted by Pastor Paul Adefarasin. He is also the host of [The African Praise Experience](https://estheradeniyi.com/the-african-praise-experience-2018/).

This year&#x2019;s Experience will hold on the 7th December 2018 at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos from 7 pm till Dawn. It is tagged &#x201C;Jesus, our Peace.&#x201D;

According to Paul Adefarasin, convener of The Experience 13, the inspiration behind the 2018 theme of the concert, &#x201C;Jesus, Our Peace&#x201D;, is to highlight who Jesus is, especially in the world we live in today &#x2013; the Prince of Peace.

&#x201C; Peace (as I know it ) is not the absence of tension but the presence of Justice, &#x201D; Paul Adefarasin says.
