So, this other blogging challenge that seems to halt or slow down your blogging &#x2013; no laptop a.k.a no necessary gadgets to run your blog effectively a.k.a no camera for your fashion blogging a.k.a I don&#x2019;t even think I am ready to blog just yet.

This blog post is going to be short, I hope. I just want to quickly share my thoughts with you as regards lack of enough materials and gadgets and resources needed to make every single one of your blogging dreams and goals come through.

### Use what you have for now

What do you have as we speak?

A smart phone? You can work around it. Do you have a friend who has a smart phone? Strike a deal with them. Do you perhaps have a neighbour whose camera/laptop you can use, can you work around it in the meantime?

Move away from the existent challenges for a while and think from outside of all of it. You&#x2019;d be surprised how much you can accomplish if you stopped complaining.

Don&#x2019;t worry, things will fall in place. Appreciate the stages you have to go through to get to where you want to be. Just use what you have for now. Start from where you are right now. You&#x2019;ll be fine.
