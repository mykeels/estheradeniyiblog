## Kechi Okwuchi renders Conqueror by Empire cast at the America&#x2019;s Got Talent 2017

&#xA0;

While some people are totally wowed at her rendition, some argue that Kechi is just an average singer who has won the hearts of people because of her plane crash survival story. You can read [Kechi&#x2019;s plane crash survival story here](https://www.earnthenecklace.com/kechi-okwuchi-wiki-the-story-of-nigeria-plane-crash-survivor-on-agt/). A lot of mixed reactions have been expressed all over social media about Kechi&#x2019;s performance at the America&#x2019;s Got Talent so far.

Nevertheless, we are glad that our own Nigerian Kechi is doing herself proud, is having fun and being who she really is and wants to be. We celebrate [young Nigerian women](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/) who are out there challenging the ordinary. She had spoken on TED and admonished young women to know themselves.

## You can watch Kechi speak at TED below:

She looked as stunning as usual. Here is what Kechi Okwuchi wore to the finals of America&#x2019;s Got Talent:

 Conqueror, find the full lyrics below:

## &#x201C;Conqueror&#x201D; (feat. Estelle & Jussie Smollett)

Life is like a big merry-go-round,

You&#x2019;re up and then down,

Going in circles trying to get to where you are.

Everybody&#x2019;s been counting you out,

But where are they now?

Sitting in the same old place,

Just faces in the crowd.

We all make mistakes,

You might fall on your face,

But you gotta get up!

[Rabababa eh by The Gratitude](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/lyrics-rabababa-eh-gratitude-coza-mp3)

[Chorus:]

I&#x2019;d rather stand tall

Than live on my knees,

&#x2018;Cause I am a conqueror,

And I won&#x2019;t accept defeat!

Try telling me no,

One thing about me

Is I am a conqueror,

I am a conqueror!

Ooh oh

Got a vision that no one else sees,

Lot of dirty work, roll up your sleeves,

Remember there&#x2019;s a war out there,

So come prepared to fight!

You never know where the road leads you,

Not everyone&#x2019;s gonna believe you,

And even though they&#x2019;re wrong, don&#x2019;t prove them right.

[Chorus:]

I&#x2019;d rather stand tall (tall)

Than live on my knees (can&#x2019;t live on my knees)

&#x2018;Cause I am a conqueror

And I won&#x2019;t accept defeat!

Try telling me no (no)

One thing about me (one thing about me)

Is I am a conqueror,

I am a conqueror!

Ooh oh (Ooh oh)

I am a conqueror!

We all make mistakes,

You might fall on your face,

But you gotta get up!

We all make mistakes,

You might fall on your face,

Don&#x2019;t ever give up!

[Chorus:]

I&#x2019;d rather stand tall (oooh)

Than live on my knees (can&#x2019;t live on my knees)

&#x2018;Cause I am a conqueror (I am a conqueror)

And I won&#x2019;t accept defeat! (And I won&#x2019;t accept defeat)

Try telling me no (try telling me no)

One thing about me (one thing about me)

Is I am a conqueror (is I am a conqueror)

I am a conqueror!

Ooh oh (Ooh oh)

I am a conqueror!

We all make mistakes,

You might fall on your face,

But I am a conqueror! (oh ooh)
