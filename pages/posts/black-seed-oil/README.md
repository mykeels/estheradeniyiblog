## Black seed oil and weight loss

Just like many of the useful herbs and good foods that we have, nothing can make you lose weight on their own. We discussed this when we talked about the [role of guava leaves and their weight loss benefits](https://estheradeniyi.com/guava-leaves-for-weight-loss/).

What black seed oil does is to help to boost your metabolism and curb your appetite. Truth is that these are two of the major factors affecting weight loss efforts.

If your metabolism is fast enough, you get to use up most or all of your food as energy thereby drastically reducing the chances of your food storing up as fat.

If your appetite is also controlled, the probability of eating junk foods and overeating is very low. Black seed oil helps to maintain glucose level and make you stay fairly full until you are ready to eat another meal.

When you add black seed oil to your food or take them as supplements, research says that this can greatly improve your digestive health and prevent/reduce your bloating. Bloating is one of the major causes of the chubby feel and protruding belly.

## How to use black seed oil

## Side effects of black seed oil

Black seed oil when taken in moderation like a lot of other herbs and naturally beneficial seeds do not cause any side effects but with overuse or abuse, there might be a bad effect.

It might lead to constipation and stomach upset. Some people also vomit when they ingest the oil or the supplementry pills. Asides from that, there is no known serious side effect of black seed oil.

For some people who are usually allergic to some certain kind of subsstances, they may have an allergic reaction when they apply this oil to their hair or their skin. This is why it is important to test the mixture or stand alone application gradually before going all in.
