Don&#x2019;t make me turn around for you

Please let me walk away with my heart unbroken

These walls hear me yearn for you

How do I describe this [love unspoken](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/romantic-love-messages-for-him)

You come to me in my dreams

But you don&#x2019;t know it

And I want to stay in my dreams

But I&#x2019;m not sure if

It&#x2019;s right, to live a lie

Knowing that you won&#x2019;t come back to me every night

And I&#x2019;ll give anything just to be the woman in your
 life

So how do I get rid of these butterflies

oooh uuuhhhh

I want to live my life for you uuuuuuhhh

I want to show the world how much I love you

You could only feel the same way too uuuuuuuhhhhhh

You will know how much it hurts me every night when

You come to me in my dream

But you don&#x2019;t know it,

And I want to stay in my dreams

But I am not sure if

its right to live a lie

Knowing that you won&#x2019;t come back to me every night

And I&#x2019;ll give anything just to be the woman in your
 life

So how do I get rid of these butterflies

See am tired of singing these lullabies,

And I don&#x2019;t know how to tell you good bye

When you don&#x2019;t even know huuuu

That I&#x2019;ve been loving yooooooouuu

Is it right to live a lie

Knowing that you won&#x2019;t come back to me every night

And I&#x2019;ll give anything just to be the woman in your
 life

So how do I

Knowing that you won&#x2019;t come back to me every night

And I&#x2019;ll give anything just to be the woman in your
 life

So how do i get rid of these butterflies

eehhhhh h&#xF9;uu yeah yeah

Get rid of these butterflies

Butterflies by Omawumi is a powerful song of
 rejected, unreturned or unnoticed love. The lyrics mixed with this melody is a
 reminder of every time we loved and wanted to feel loved in return. We realize
 rather too late that we just have to get rid of these butterflies to move on
 better and freer.
