From Wednesday 25th July till Friday 27th July, [Teens Going for Gold Network](https://estheradeniyi.com/teach-a-teen-campaign-2018/), an organization dedicated to grooming value-driven teenagers to become socially conscious and financially self reliant, welcomed over 35 participants to Lerato Comprehensive College Iyana Ipaja where the training phase of **Project Teach a Teen** took place.

On the first day, the participants who were mainly between ages ten to nineteen, were trained on the following topics: Enterprise Education, Financial Literacy, Global Citizenship Education (GCED), Ethical Leadership and Sex Education. The session on Global Citizenship Education was delivered in partnership with **One African Child Foundation for Creative Learning**. All participants were excited to learn something new and beyond learning, the facilitators encouraged them to apply all they had learnt.

From Thursday 25th July till Friday 27th, the participants were engaged in different vocational classes. The different classes from which participants made a choice include Bag Making (with Ankara and some other fabrics), Cake Baking and Decoration, Gele tying and Makeup, Making of Soap and Perfume and Web Design. At end of the training, participants were awarded certificates of participation and there was an exhibition of all the finished products made by the participants.

The **Teach a Teen program** will also hold in Ibadan on 6th and 7th August 2018 at Jesus Kids Orphanage. This training is a followup to the **#TeachATeen campaign** that was on throughout the month of June. Founded by 24 year-old **Pelumi Obisesan**, Teens Going for Gold Network is securing the next generation from poverty and also building active global citizens.
