## I know who I am Lyrics

[Verse 1]
 We are a chosen generation
 We&#x2019;ve been called forth to show His excellence
 All I require for life, God has given me
**And I know who I am**
 We are a chosen generation
 We&#x2019;ve been called forth to show His excellence
 All I require for life, God has given me
 For I know who I am

[Chorus 1]
 I know who God says I am, what He says I am
 Where He says I&#x2019;m at, I know who I am
 I know who God says I am, what He says I am
 Where He says I&#x2019;m at, I know who I am
 I&#x2019;m working in power, I&#x2019;m working miracles
 I live a life of favour, for I know who I am
 I&#x2019;m working in power, I&#x2019;m working miracles
 I live a life of favour, for I know who I am

[Verse]
 We are a chosen generation
 We&#x2019;ve been called forth to show His excellence
 All I require for life, God has given me
 And I know who I am
 We are a chosen generation
 We&#x2019;ve been called forth to show His excellence
 All I require for life, God has given me
 And I know who I am
