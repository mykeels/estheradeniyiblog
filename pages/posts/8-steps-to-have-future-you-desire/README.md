 There are two categories of people: those living in the present but are stuck in their past, and; those living in the present but have moved on from their past.

If you fall in the first category, &#xA0;you can decide to stop the negative influence of the past by taking these next 8 steps to help &#xA0;yourself live a future you desire.

The future is beautiful and bright for those who have the imagination to see it daily.

Some are already living in the present hoping to see the future but still have a lot of things to deal with in the past, if you find &#xA0;yourself in such category, here are the 8 steps &#xA0;you can consider to live your life without &#xA0;the weight of your past affecting you.

1. REVEAL THE PAST

Have you been hiding your &#xA0;past &#xA0;from &#xA0;the reality it needs &#xA0;to face, and so it keeps hurting you?

What you resist will persist. If you don&#x2019;t deal with your &#xA0;past, it will &#xA0;deal with you some day. So before &#xA0;your &#xA0;past deal &#xA0;with &#xA0;you, deal with it. &#xA0;Face it, and heal from it. &#xA0;Get help if possible from a professional counsellor.

2. &#xA0;EVALUATE THE PAST.

Every experience has its lessons attached to it. &#xA0;So when &#xA0;you are revealing &#xA0;your &#xA0;past, look out &#xA0;for the lessons. Don&#x2019;t &#xA0;dwell &#xA0;on the mistakes, &#xA0;instead learn from it. Stop living in denial of yourself, face it, accept it, learn from it and extract new lessons. The lessons will &#xA0;make you better when taking &#xA0;steps forward.

3. DEFINE THE PRESENT

Your &#x2018;Now&#x2019; is important and you have got &#xA0;to be conscious and deliberate about &#xA0;it. Define what you need to do. Until you are sure of what, where, and how you want the present to look like, &#xA0;you will go on confused. Instead &#xA0;of being &#xA0;confused, get to work and plan how &#xA0;you want your &#xA0;life to look &#xA0;like &#xA0;so you can deliberately work on it.

4. EDUCATE THE PRESENT WHAT MAKES UP YOUR PAST

Learning &#xA0;is continuous and you can only get better when you keep educating your self. So inform the Now (the present) what happened in the past. Get a purpose for your self , and your &#xA0;purpose at this point &#xA0;will &#xA0;give a road map to your future.

5. FORM THE PRESENT

&#x201C;All experts are experts on what was. There is no expert on what will be. To become an expert on the future, vision must replace experience,&#x201D; said David Ben-Gurion, the prime minister of Israel. There is a need to form &#xA0;how &#xA0;you want your present to look &#xA0;like. &#xA0;You can create a vision board that you can daily work on. &#xA0;It puts you on your toes &#xA0;and serve as a reminder &#xA0;of what you aim to achieve.

6. IGNITE THE PRESENT

Whatever principle has worked for you over time, believe in it, uphold it. &#xA0;Personally give your best to know more irrespective of whatever might surface in your &#xA0;journey. Show your self approved to your goals.

7. NURTURE THE PRESENT

Personally developing yourself will help you grow &#xA0;and get necessary knowledge &#xA0;to your &#xA0;vision &#xA0;in life. &#x201D;Personal development is the reason you shouldn&#x2019;t stop growing.&#x201D;

8. EVALUATE AHEAD OF THE FUTURE

Check yourself &#xA0;from &#xA0;time &#xA0;to time. &#xA0;Know &#xA0;when &#xA0;to make corrections. &#xA0;There are times &#xA0;mistakes will &#xA0;reoccur, what &#xA0;makes &#xA0;it beautiful is when &#xA0;you can learn &#xA0;from &#xA0;it and move &#xA0;on. &#xA0;Know &#xA0;that &#x201C;greatness is not determined by what a man drives but by the values that drive the man&#x201D;. Your values will &#xA0;keep &#xA0;you going when &#xA0;you can checkmate your self &#xA0;from &#xA0;time to time &#xA0;and give your life the right &#xA0;medication it needs.

&#x201C;Your past needs healing from you, &#xA0;your future needs acceptance and your present needs ownership from you.&#x201D;
 &#x2013; Dayo Samuel

You can live your best life today by taking charge of what makes up your life.
