**Johnny Drille** is the face of Alternative music in Nigeria as we speak. He is one of my favorite musicians because really, he is all there is to authentic, original and captivating music. What won&#x2019;t you like about Johnny Drille? Before we browse through his songs, a little for **Johnny Drille&#x2019;s Biography.**

Johnny Drille whose real name is **John Ighodaro** is a Nigerian musician from Edo State. He is a graduate of English and Literature from the University of Benin in 2012. He is born into a clergy family. Both of his parents are pastors and that posed a little problem in his music because they found it difficult to understand why he would go into romantic music instead of the much anticipated [gospel music](https://estheradeniyi.com/tag/gospel-music/).

He has been singing since he was very young. Johnny Drille was also a participant of the 6th&#xA0;Edition of the MTN Project Fame Academy in 2013. He was evicted at the 10th&#xA0;position. On the 28th of February, 2017, **Mavin Records** officially announced that he had been signed.
