**The Sunshine Blogger Award** is for new Bloggers. I was once nominated when I was a year into blogging. I can&#x2019;t seem to find the post anymore. It must have gone when I rebranded the blog some four years ago.

This time around, [Yinka Adeniyi](https://yinkaadeniyi.com/the-sunshine-blogger-award-nomination/) nominated me again. Even though it might defeat the purpose of The Sunshine Blogger Award, I am still going to accept and answer the questions she asked me because they are very fun.

Usually, the Sunshine Bloggers Award is to foster a strong community amongst (new) Bloggers that have just started blogging so that they feel a sense of belonging and are encouraged to put out more content. So, when you nominate, you nominate someone who is just months or a few years into blogging.

I am however still going to be a part of this. It would be disrespectful to leave Yinka&#x2019;s questions hanging. Thank you very much for nominating me Yinka and the kind words you have for me and my blog are blessings. Thank you!

I am not proud to say this but I have never been to my hometown before. I guess we wouldn&#x2019;t ever have to even meet there in the first place. Lol.

**2. What is your blog about?**

My blog is a Blogging and Women Lifestyle blog. I write blog articles to help new Bloggers and even long-time Bloggers have a smooth blogging ride.

I also have a mix of interesting lifestyle articles to spice up the blog. Some of the major categories on the blog are career, movie reviews, product reviews, life lessons, and personal development.

**3. If you could leave everything and move to another country, where would you go?**

I have never given this a thought before but now that I have to, I&#x2019;ll pick Canada.

**4. Who inspires you to be better?**

My future self

**5. What has been your most successful post? Why do you think it was appealing?**

[How waking up at 5 AM literally changed my life](https://estheradeniyi.com/waking-up-at-5-am-literally-changed-my-life/). It has received a total of approximately 400,000 views to date.

A lot of people are constantly searching for how to maximize one of the most important times of the day- mornings. They find it more difficult to accomplish because they can&#x2019;t seem to wake up early. My post was a no-nonsense, practical and personal approach to this issue. I was clear, honest and helpful.

**6. Have you met anyone interesting/famous on your blogging journey? Mention them**

No, I have not

**7. What do you do in your spare time?**

I watch movies, a lot of them.&#xA0;

**8. When was the last time you gave someone a gift? And what was it?**

I gifted someone who is trying to get their feet back up 20,000 Naira.&#xA0;

**9. What is your favorite thing about your blog?**

My blog readers. They have been one of the greatest push I need. My blog would be absolutely nothing without them. I am blessed to have feedback and lots of love through the comments section and my emails. Sometimes, they come as far as my Instagram dm. It&#x2019;s just amazing.

**10. How has blogging changed your life?**

I have learned the true meaning of the word consistency with blogging. Blogging has given me a sense of dedication to something. I have been blessed to meet people on this journey, they have changed my life in so many other ways that are not even blogging related.&#xA0;

**11. If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be and why?**

I have never given that a thought. I guess I would be a Christmas tree.&#xA0;
