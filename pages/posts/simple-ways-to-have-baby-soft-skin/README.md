## Tips, methods and natural ways to have baby soft skin

While some people are naturally blessed with **baby soft skin texture**, others have to work it out. The weather, nature of our skin, aging, bad skin products and so many other things are factors that affect our skins and causes us to be stripped of our naturally baby soft skin. This post exposes us to ways we can get a soft baby-like skin.

### *Avoid taking hot water baths.

Use cold or warm water for taking baths to lock moisture to skin. Taking a hot water bath strips the [natural moisturizing oils](https://www.nylon.com/articles/natural-oil-moisturizers?fb_comment_id=924719104245373_925067300877220) from body, making skin dry and rough.

### *Use moisturizing soaps and apply moisturizing creams

Use moisturizing soaps to bath to have baby soft skin. Unlike other soaps these products contain moisturizing properties that help in getting baby soft skin. After taking a bath, apply a good moisturizing lotion or cream to your skin. After taking baths our skin becomes soft and hence it easily absorbs the moisture that is provided by these products. For sensitive skin type, use baby oils to get silky skin.

### *Clear dead and dry skin.

To have baby soft skin, exfoliate skin once a week to clean skin pores from dirt, oils, and dead skin cells. This method helps in removing roughness from the skin, making skin soft. But it also makes skin dry, hence remember to moisturize skin after exfoliating.

There are also natural ways to having baby soft skin, some of which are :

#### *Natural oil treatment.

Use skin softening oils like almond oil, coconut oil, olive oil for providing vitamin E to the skin and thus deeply moisturizing skin cells making it smooth. Apply coconut or olive oil to skin before sleeping. Wash in the morning and moisturize again.

#### *Avocado moisturizing paste.

Make a paste of avocado and apply it to your skin and wash it after 15 minutes for getting skin like a baby.

#### *Honey and milk for baby soft skin.

Add honey to milk cream and apply it to the skin. After 20 minutes, wash it with warm water.

#### *Fruit hydration masks.

[Apply banana to your skin](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/diy-banana-mask-for-hair-and-skin) and wash it after 20 minutes. Banana is rich in lots of cousins and minerals that keep our skin fresh. [Papaya face mask](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/diy-pawpaw-mask-for-natural-hair-and) is also good for clearing dirt and moisturizing skin.

#### *Honey massage for smooth skin.

Massage honey to skin for 10 minutes and leave it for another 10 minutes. This will help to retain water to skin, making it soft and beautiful. Honey can be mixed with lemon for removing impurities from the skin and making it smooth.

#### *Aloe vera skin conditioner

Aloe vera is also an excellent skin conditioner that is used to get healthy skin. Aloe gel contains antioxidants and moisture that help in making skin soft and supple like a baby. Apply this gel to the skin and leave it for 10 minutes. Now wash it with cold or warm water.
