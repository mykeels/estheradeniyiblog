## You&#x2019;re Doing It All Again by Todd Dulaney ft Nicole Harris Lyrics

You make a blind man see
 Make a lame man walk again
 You cause the dead to rise
 And that&#x2019;s why we dance in liberty
 &#x2018;Cause you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; it all again

Also: [Victory belongs to Jesus by Todd Dulaney](https://estheradeniyi.com/todd-dulaney-victory-belongs-to-jesus/)

Yeah, yeah
 &#x2018;Cause you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; it all again
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 (Say it!)
 You make a blind man see
 (You make a blind man see)
 Make the lame man walk again
 (You make the lame man walk again)
 You cause the dead to rise
 (You cause the dead to rise)
 And that&#x2019;s why we dance in liberty
 (And that&#x2019;s why we dance in liberty)
 (Come on, shout it you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; that dance!)
 (Doin&#x2019; it all again)
 Oh, oh, oh, sing it!
 (&#x2018;Cause you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; it all again)
 Oh, sing it! (Oh, Oh)
 Hey, said you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; it all again
 Oh, yeah, yeah, come on!
 Oh, yeah, said you&#x2019;re still saving
 You&#x2019;re the same God, yeah
 You&#x2019;re still healing
 He&#x2019;s the same God
 Come on, say still create! (Still create)
 You&#x2019;re the same God, same God (Same God)
 Chain breaking (Chain breaking)

 Come on, who&#x2019;s not singing?
 He won&#x2019;t change, oh (He won&#x2019;t change)

 You&#x2019;re the same God as you were yesterday
 (Never ending, same God)

 And we told you, you are Jesus
 (You are Jesus, the same God)
 I called you Holy
 (You are Holy, the same God)
 He&#x2019;s coming to see about you, my redeemer
 (My redeemer, the same God)
 He&#x2019;s making a way out of no way, and my provider
 (My provider, the same God)
 Now we gonna sing this part together, hey
