This was written by Akan Imoh.&#xA0; You can find more of his intelligent thoughts on [Facebook.&#xA0;](https://web.facebook.com/upcoming.ng)&#xA0;Now, read what he writes below:

&#x201C;I have come to realize that to succeed and become the best at what you do, 60% of the requirement is content (what you know), 20% is relationship (who you know) and the other 20% is packaging (how you present what you know). I call this &#x2018;The Daddy Yo Strategy&#x2019;. This theory was founded and postulated by me.

 2. Packaging
 3. Networking

## Content:

This is the point where you work so hard on your craft. You stop focusing on haters and rumours, you dedicate time to learning and improving on your craft. You watch YouTube Videos, go for training, attend seminars and all.

You can&#x2019;t be the best at what you do if you don&#x2019;t have a 100% grasp of what you do. You must be extremely good at it. If you&#x2019;re woken up from sleep, you should be able to deliver. Content is key. Ability is key. There&#x2019;s no amount of branding or packaging or connection you&#x2019;ll have if you&#x2019;re not good at what you do, its all a waste.

## Packaging:

If you&#x2019;re good at what you do, and you don&#x2019;t begin to understand that you must package yourself well, you&#x2019;ll just be an extremely excellent person doing great things in one small corner of the world and no one knows about you. Never joke with your packaging.

We have too many people who don&#x2019;t know what they are doing but are enjoying success. Simply because they packaged well and got famous.

## Networking:

Finally, don&#x2019;t forget this one. You can be the best at what you do, have the best branding. But, if you don&#x2019;t cultivate relationships, you&#x2019;re on your way to failure. At this point, you&#x2019;ll need people to hold your hands and lead you into the jungle. Some people just need to write a note to another person for you and doors will be opened for you.

This is the time to begin to cultivate relationships in your field. Make connections. I repeat, make connections. Very very key. Look out for the important stakeholders and begin to strategize on how to meet them. Learn to give gifts. You want that guy to be your mentor, have you thought about doing something to make him smile? You must give to be given.

Some of you are stingy even to your destiny. Please, don&#x2019;t be. That man *ehn*, yes, he already has so much money, and might not need anything you buy for him, but, just still buy. A pack of white handkerchief will do wonders, you won&#x2019;t believe this. A bottle of wine can open doors for you that will shock you.&#x201D;

That was a very profound read up there by Akan Imoh but before I sign off from here, I want you to watch this video below. It&#x2019;s the shortest you can ever watch, so really, do watch. What I have come to realize is that people want you to be safe and balanced but the question is: how bad do you want this?
