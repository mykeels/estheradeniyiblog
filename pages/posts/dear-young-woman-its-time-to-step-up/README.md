 Dear Young Woman,

 It is a beautiful day as the sun
 shines mildly on a day when the country celebrates her democracy day. We cannot
 refuse to see the positive steps we have taken as a country. We also cannot but
 see how far we could have gotten if we indeed sailed with caution over the past
 five decades. The struggles are real as people wake up every day to different
 levels of uncertainties especially bothering on the side of hunger. People need
 food to survive and a vast majority of this responsibility, in a family
 setting, boils down on the woman.

 Our struggles are laid bare
 before us and so is the answer towards survival. As the society gradually,
 albeit slowly, begins to embrace the emancipation of women from being just
 housekeepers and homemakers to successful career women, we must begin to
 continually be reminded not to rest on the successes. It is not a fight against
 men, as some school of thought will always like to turn the narrative. But the
 message should be about having the same and equal opportunity to compete,
 contest and aim towards same positions as a man would.

 We should remind ourselves again,
 today, that it is not an issue of standing shoulder to shoulder with the man
 because in the true sense of it, using the man as a yardstick of measurement,
 already is a wrong perception to the basis of the matter. So we say it is not
 as fight. It is yearn for equality &#x2013; a mental reorientation of treating every
 one equally, irrespective of gender.

 Women have indeed recorded
 successes overtime and so have men. The same can be said of the failings and
 failures for both genders. We all need to begin to beyond the judgmental eye of
 &#x201C;a man would have done it better&#x201D; or &#x201C;a woman should not have been given the
 mandate&#x201D;. No size fits all, and to each, his/her own destiny. Men are breaking
 records every day and so are women. Women are making new discoveries every day
 and so are men.

 It is a public holiday and a time
 to look inward to see how far we have come as a country, but just may be we
 need to see beyond that. Maybe we should look beyond where we are and start
 seeing where we need to be.

 Dear Young Woman, it is time to
 step up.
