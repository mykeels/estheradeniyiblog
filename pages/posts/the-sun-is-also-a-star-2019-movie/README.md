I can&#x2019;t believe I made it out of &#x201C;**The Sun is also a Star**&#x201C;. Night movies are not supposed to be boring else you sleep through the entirety of it all. I guess I was just curious to know what the heck was happening.

Watching the trailer was worth it though, I guess I should have stopped at that.

## The sun is also a star movie trailer

I have come to find out that this movie was adapted from a book &#x2013;**The Sun Is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon**. I think that this is the kind of story that looks good on paper, that you read instead of watch. Speaking of igniting fantasy and unrealistic happenings, it may be worth some daydreaming with.

Nicola Yoon is also the author of Everything, Everything. This book, Everything Everything was well adapted and in my opinion, the kind of book you make into a movie in the first place. [Everything, Everything movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything,_Everything_(film)) was way awesome!

The sun is also a star was adapted to help us understand a few facts about life most probably, some of which I totally agree with so if you ask me- what were your takeaways, I would say these:

&#x2013; Love is a responsibility. We have a part to play even if it is as simple as being ready. Closed doors don&#x2019;t allow blessings.

&#x2013; Opening your heart and seizing moments might just be all you need to get to the next great moment.

&#x2013; What matters is how you enjoy what you have. The future will happen, events will occur but what you have here and now, you can relish, make memories of them and create beautiful experiences out of them. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have forever, all we have is a single day.

It was difficult to watch the unrealistic parts of the scenes. Heck, some of them were rather annoying. The actors were great but the story was wack.
