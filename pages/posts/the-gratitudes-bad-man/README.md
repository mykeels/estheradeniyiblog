I am not too sure I subscribed to The Gratitude, COZA&#x2019;s channel but the notification was just as welcome as if I did. I think The Gratitude&#x2019;s concerts and live performances are too sleek to be free. Aha!

Did you enjoy it? The lyrics are below just if you are curious.

## Bad Man by The Gratitude Lyrics

One time for the winner man
 One time for the winner man
 One time, two times&#x2026;

Pause!
 One time for the winner man
 Ain&#x2019;t no time wey my God no be winner man
 See, you fit bring the challenges
 and situations but my God is bigger than
 See, me go dance for me maker
 From Nigeria down to Jamaica
 Forever and ever
 Them a talk talk but whatever

When I wake up
 All I see is
 Your goodness Lord
 Spreads around me
 No matter what it is that ever comes my way
 I&#x2019;ll surely sing my sing
 I wanna go RABABABA

When the bad man them a think say them dey do me strong thing
 Them no know say them a swerving, them a dulling
 &#x2018;Cause Baba God dey strong for my side me I fear no nothing
 All the things you dey do for me Baba I dey reason say

 You are God o (You are God o)
 You are good (You are good)

 See the way wey you dey do me, dey make me dey go high
 And the way e dey do me I want to say, Abba! Father, haaba!
 Dem no go understand the way you love me&#x2026;

Every time you lay your hands in me I get high and I&#x2019;m drunk
 The mighty man I have in me frees me oh my God I dey feel ar&#x2019;e&#x2026;
 Oya make you follow me follow me go simmado
 Ye Yesu ya komalo

Once upon a time (&#x2018;pun a time)
 See my life was in total blackness
 And I be like yes sir (yes sir)
 To the man with the darker soul
 But then you came around and turned my life around
 Now I gat a good life na na na&#x2026;

It was really nice to meet you (meet you. meet you. meet you)
 It was really nice to meet you (meet you. meet you. meet you)

When the bad man them a think say them dey do me strong thing
 Them no know say them a swerving, them a dulling
 &#x2018;Cause Baba God dey strong for my side me I fear no nothing
 All the things you dey do for me Baba I dey reason say

You are good (You are good)
 You are God o (You are God o)
 You are good (You are good)
 You are God o (You are God o)
 You are good (You are good)
 You are God o (You are God o)

These days you dey blow my mind you dey make me jolly
 You bless me Baba eh! Now I dey getti money
 You no dey leave me alone
 Every time I call you dey pick your phone
 No matter where you dey
 You no dey delay
 That&#x2019;s why me I say
 Baba mi ese

Super father, super man yeah
 You&#x2019;re superficial my life&#x2026;

Daddy mi o, Daddy mi o, all your blessings for me overflow
 Taking me higher than overdose
 Taking me higher than overdose
 Daddy mi o, Daddy mi o, all your blessings for me overflow
 Taking me higher than overdose

 &#x201C;Na Yah be my daddy&#x201D;
 (God is my father)

When the bad man them a think say them dey do me strong thing
 Them no know say them a swerving, them a dulling

 All the things you dey do for me Baba I dey reason say

You are good (You are good)
 You are God o (You are God o)
