**She Pi** initiative is a programme aimed at building and training young women who are interested in advancing their technological curiosities. We are geared and pushed by the need to solve problems that affect us as a whole in the country and outside the shores using technology in form of **Raspberry Pi** &#x2013; electronic hardware, software and its applications.

We are determined to empower and be a source of inspiration to [young women all over the world](https://estheradeniyi.com/struggles-facing-young-women-career/), starting from Nigeria. We want to build a generation of women who pant after solving problems of all kinds using the Raspberry Pi. These young women will be innovators and change-makers.

We hereby call for applications for the **She-Pi jam workshop** which will be held in Lagos.
