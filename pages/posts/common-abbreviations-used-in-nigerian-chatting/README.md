Today is Friday and we are hoping to catch fun with some of the abbreviations we use here in Nigeria. While some of the acronyms are used worldwide as well, some of the others are used only in Nigeria and that&#x2019;s because they have the full meaning in pidgin English.

Except for the unnecessary short words that people abbreviate like k, sup, hy, I love these other ones because of all of the fun they add to chatting as a whole. Of course, some of them are usually exaggerated though.

Nigerian social media has changed sha. Do you remember [my post on annoying things people say on social media](https://estheradeniyi.com/annoying-things-people-say-on-socia/)? Of all of them, I hate &#x201C;k&#x201D; the most. Not even after I have written an epistle should you use &#x201C;k&#x201D; for me. Hia!

Let&#x2019;s just roll in some weekend fun. Please add your own list of common abbreviations Used in Nigerian chatting in the comments section, I will add the whole lot I know.

## What is the meaning of LOL?

LOL means Laughing Out Loud. Let me not forget to mention that this is the most abused of all of the common slangs in Nigeria. I would like to think that LOL is also used in lazy conversations.

You are chatting with someone and because you are trying to avoid an in-depth conversation, you LOL.

And then some years ago, another sect of jobless humans began to propagate a lot of nonsense about LOL.

They claimed that the full meaning of LOL is Lucifer Our Lord. People of God, the frequency with which people used the LOL that was so dear to us reduced o.
