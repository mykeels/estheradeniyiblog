#Hairgoals has been the trending hashtag on social media for a while now, &#xA0;but do we really have [hair goals](http://lifestyle.ynaija.com/hair-goals-maintaining-growing-natural-hair-like-yemi-alade/)? What steps are we taking to bring our goals to realization?

Growing natural hair is just like a handling a project and every project must have a goal target. Let&#x2019;s look at some of the goals we can have for our natural hair and ways we can reach those girls.

*Hair length

It is not everyone that wants a long hair, really. But for we that do, here are some of the things we can do to achieve it

&#x2013; Use a hair lengthening DIY mask seasonally
 &#x2013; Make hairstyles that promote hair growth and avoid styles that cause breakage
 &#x2013; Apply [lemon on hair](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/diy-lemon-fruit-mask-for-hair-and-skin-1) regularly
 For short hair length, hair should be trimmed regularly to desired length

* Soft hair

 It&#x2019;s a joyful thing to have a soft natural hair. Stubborn hair is quite difficult to manage. To get soft hair
 &#x2013; oil your hair as often as possible
 &#x2013; use a hair softening DIY hair mask. ( I&#x2019;ll recommend banana because it worked wonders on my hair)
 -deep condition your hair frequently

*Break-free hair

Natural hair is more prone to [breakage](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/hair-breakage-easy-ways-to-avoid-this) than relaxed hair. &#xA0;To gain strength for your hair

&#x2013; Oil hair regularly
 &#x2013; Avoid washing made hair
 &#x2013; Use an anti-breakage DIY hair mask
 &#x2013; Trim hair regularly
 &#x2013; Avoid washing hair with very hot water

These are just a few of the several goals we can set for our hair as naturalists if we&#x2019;re going to have be a successful one. It&#x2019;s possible to fail in an attempt to go natural if the right things are not done.
 Make your natural hair the light that will draw others to become naturalist today?
