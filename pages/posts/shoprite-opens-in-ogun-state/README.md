*coughs* Hello people, what&#x2019;s pumping? We have good news for our Ogun people o. And it&#x2019;s Shoprite! **Shoprite in Ogun state** opened officially on Monday, 19th of December, 2016.

And they didn&#x2019;t have to shout about this, &#xA0;Shoprite was overflooded. It was full and overflowing. So, &#xA0;I went sight seeing yesterday and I was thrilled with this new development. It was glowing red and yellow with balloons. I can&#x2019;t wait to see what this place will look like on the 25th of December and shortly after.

Anyone would think that Shoprite would open in Abeokuta but yippee, y&#x2019;all wrong. Sango Ota got the attention.

Ota is really slow in developing and I hope that this will mark a new beginning. Gateway hotel used to be one of the happening places in Ota but well, &#xA0;it went down along the line. I hear that there are plans to resuscitate Gateway hotel by the state governor. For now, Shoprite is the wave of the moment.

&#xA0;

Shoprite is located along Abeokuta Expressway in Sango-Ota,Ogun State.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x201C;It is after the toll gate between Lagos and Ogun State, a few kilometers away from the Headquarters of Nigerian NewsDirect, the official newspaper in Ogun State.&#x201D;(News Direct). &#xA0;&#xA0;You might also want to check out the entire of [Palms mall ](http://thepalmshoppingmall.com/lekki/)too.
