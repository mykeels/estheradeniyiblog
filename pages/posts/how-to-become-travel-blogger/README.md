Travel blogging is fun as long as you know what you want to do. The process starts from deciding on what you want to blog about to actually blogging. There are so many in-between processes which involve getting an appropriate domain, actually traveling (hopefully, round the world), making your first travel post, gaining blog readers, making first time visitors [fall hopelessly in love with your blog](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-to-make-people-fall-hopelessly-in) and connecting with other bloggers in your niche.

Many times, new Travel Bloggers get confused along the line. In fact, some almost never know what to do with their travel blogs as they begin to incessantly brainstorm blog post ideas. I have to personally admit that the journey to being a successful blogger is full of a lot of ups and downs and that&#x2019;s why, really, it&#x2019;s just best to stand on the shoulders of those who have been there.

I, in conjunction with other Lifestyle/Travel Nigerian bloggers have collaborated with [TravelStart&#xA0;Nigeria](https://www.travelstart.com.ng/) to provide a very informative info-graphic. This material is to give you an overview of what it takes to be a Travel Blogger and how to successfully pull this off. It&#x2019;s a process, remember?
