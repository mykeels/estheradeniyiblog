## Components of a keto diet

An effective keto diet should be made of 70 to 75 percent of fat, 20 to 25 percent of protein and 5 to 10 percent of carbohydrates. Though it should be in small quantity, every healthy diet must include some carbs because they have their own nutrients. You don&#x2019;t want to cope with nutrient deficiency issues.

## Keto diet food list

It may sound easy, but it is not. It is difficult to figure out the kind of foods to eat to be able to maintain the percentages. However, here is a list of what to eat if you are serious about putting your body in ketosis.

To achieve 70 to 75 percent fats, you can eat foods like olive oil, coconut oil, or any other plant-based oil, avocado, ghee, and butter.

For 20 to 25 percent of protein, you can take eggs, beef, fish, poultry, cottage cheese, and plain Greek yoghurt.

For low carbs, you can take onion, kale, tomato, Brussels sprouts, Raspberries, and broccoli. The kind of drinks to take on a keto diet are tea, coffee, water, and occasionally, you can take a little bit of red wine.

## Things to avoid

While on a keto diet, you should avoid foods like fruits, potatoes, pasta, soda, juice, chocolates, candies, donuts, bread, cooked rice, and beer.

**Monitor your ketones level**

The biggest challenge with this diet is that it may take your body several days to enter ketosis and one wrong food can kick you out of ketosis.

This is why it is important to monitor your ketones level constantly. You should know when you are in or out of ketosis. There are simple to use keto strips to help you measure your ketones level. You can get some information about keto strips on the internet.

In fact, [https://www.ketogenicsupplementreviews.com/ketone-urine-strips/](https://www.ketogenicsupplementreviews.com/ketone-urine-strips/) and many other websites offer useful information on keto strips. Once your ketones level drops, it means part of the foods you ate within the last 24 hours contains a lot of carbs.

In that case, you need to review all what you ate and figure the exact food, drink, or snacks that caused the problem.
 Contraindications of the diet

Unfortunately, not everyone is qualified for this diet. The following category of people are not eligible for the diet.

Mothers who are still breastfeeding their babies cannot take this diet.
 Patients of high blood pressure are barred from the diet
 Diabetic patients are also prohibited from the diet.

However, not being among these categories of people does not give automatic eligibility for the diet.

There are other conditions or drugs that may prevent people from switching to the diet. This is why you need to involve your doctor. In other words, you need your doctor&#x2019;s go ahead before you start.

## Good keto meals

Some delicious and easy to prepare keto meals are:

Broccoli and Feta Omelette
 Sesame Chicken Thighs with Broccoli
 Keto Bread
 Keto Pizza

Conclusively, you need to keep going for a general medical check up while on the diet because some health issues have been linked to the diet.

Sodium deficiency, high cholesterol, irregular periods, and constipation have been linked to the diet. Nevertheless, its efficacy in [weight loss](https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm) is irrefutable.
