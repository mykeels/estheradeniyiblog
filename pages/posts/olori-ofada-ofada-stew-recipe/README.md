Ofada stew is the life and essence of Ofada rice. I mean, without this Olofi Ofada proper, your ofada rice is going to taste like your normal rice. This is absolutely not what we want, right? We want the aroma, the taste and even the seductive appeal of the ofada stew. It&#x2019;s not a bad idea to therefore know how to make ofada stew by yourself, in your home.

N:B

1. It&#x2019;s better to use palm oil than any other oil to make the [stew](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/how-to-prepare-thick-egusi-soup-yummy) less peppery.
 2. If you cannot get unripe/green pepper you can use ripe/red pepper and make sure you blend locust beans with it to bring out that brownish colour Olori Ofada/ ofada stew has.
 3. Blend plenty onions together with the pepper, &#xA0;it also makes it less peppery.
 4. After adding everything you need to add to the stew while cooking, &#xA0;you don&#x2019;t have to cover the pot while still cooking, it will make the stew to get thick easily.
