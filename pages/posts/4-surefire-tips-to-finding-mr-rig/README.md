 While
 many women truly enjoy the single life, others are ready to find their &#x201C;MR.
 RIGHT&#x201D; and begin a new chapter in the story of their lives. Whether you&#x2019;re new
 to the game or you&#x2019;ve been dating a bunch of &#x2018;good for nothing&#x2019;, this article
 is meant for you.&#xA0;&#xA0;

In this article I
 would be highlighting and discussing five basic and crucial tips to finding the
 right guy noting that everyone is different but this tips can be applied by
 almost anyone and still achieve positive results.

 1. Know
 What You Want: The most important part about finding Mr. right is that you must
 not sit around waiting for him to find you. You have to go out and find him.
 Even Cinderella got herself to the ball! And the first step to finding the
 right guy is &#x201C;know what you want&#x201D; from a man and the relationship if not, how
 would you know the right guy when he comes? Setting your priorities straight
 and having standards enable you to know the right guy when he comes your way
 noting that more often than not, the right guy may not meet up to all the
 standards that you have set for yourself but meeting most of it if not all is
 an important factor to also look out for.&#xA0;
From his dress sense to the way he
 relates with others, you would have your preferences so why not include them in
 the list of how you want your man to look like and behave because why would you
 want to be in a relationship with someone that doesn&#x2019;t possess the
 characteristics you like and end up feeling embarrassed about him around your
 friends? So once you have your list ready you know what to look out for and
 possible places of finding him.

 2. &#xA0;Know
 Where To Look: All types of men cannot be found everywhere, different places with
 different types and class of men. So knowing what you (kind of man) are looking
 for would determine the place to go look for him, just like a Christian lady
 looking for a faithful Christian Brother cannot go looking for him in the club.&#xA0;
After&#xA0;you&#x2019;ve figured out the kind of guy you&#x2019;re looking for, go to neighborhoods
 where such guys are concentrated to have your lunch or just hang out, this
 means you should be willing to talk to guys you don&#x2019;t know

 3. &#xA0;Know
 How To Look: In knowing how to look, you can also ask your friends for their

 opinions about the guys in your life, you never can
 tell&#x2026;.. Mr. Right might just have been a table away from you at the office and
 people get to see what you don&#x2019;t! Remember that you&#x2019;ve set your standards so
 use that as a guide to choosing, from looking at his priorities to the way he
 talks to and about you and everything else in between, these are signs to watch
 out for. Does he try to avoid calling you his girlfriend when introducing you?
 Has he been reluctant to introduce you to his parents despite the fact that
 you&#x2019;ve been dating for a while?&#xA0;
These are bad signs and you should also watch
 out for how he talks to you. Is he insulting and always hurting your feelings
 with his words? Even when you have flaws, Mr. right would help you making
 yourself better rather than rubbing your imperfections in your face and he
 would do this by being patient with you not instead of pressuring you.

 4.&#xA0;&#xA0;Be
 Mrs. Right: Get a life! The most important thing is to be Mrs. Right yourself.
 Finding the right man is not going to change you into a better person than you
 already are. If you are lazy and self-centered, finding a generous and
 hardworking man would not transform you, it would rather create an unhealthy&#xA0; imbalance in the relationship noting that no
 one would want to have a lazy person as a life partner.&#xA0;
So try to model
 yourself after women you admire. Work hard at changing your character defects
 (if you are not sure what they are, ask your mum), get a hobby, complete your
 education and learn to be happy with yourself first because no man, no matter
 how right is going to make you happy if you aren&#x2019;t already happy from within.
