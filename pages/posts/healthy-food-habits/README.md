The first item on our list is berries. They come in various forms like blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. The best item for us is strawberries as they are full of Vitamin C, the wonder vitamin.

Like berries, nuts also come in various shapes and sizes like almonds, groundnuts, walnuts and cashew nuts. The most important nut for us is almonds as they help us replenish our reserves of Vitamin E that will help in increasing the strength and volume of hair.

You need to combine the increase of nuts in your diet with the use of hair care products like oils, shampoos and conditioners to get better results. Consuming almonds can be supplemented with applying perfumed [jasmine hair oil](http://www.kmpayurvedic.com/kmp-ayurvedic-jasmine-hair-oil/) that will uplift your mood and add the zing back to your hair!

### Soybeans

Soybeans help in promoting hair growth as they are powerhouses of protein. They contain a compound called as spermidine that helps in increasing hair growth during the initial anagen phase.

Soybeans are well loved all over the world because of their antioxidant properties. They also help protect against heart disease due to their intrinsic qualities. You can have it in the form of Nutrela soya chunks or even Tofu that is Soybean curd.

Both are extremely useful for enhancing the quality of your hair that will make hair care a cake walk. Just combine its consumption with the application of a moisturizing conditioner that will help you get spectacular results in a short period of time.

Beans can be of various types like French Beans, Plain Beans, and Kidney Beans. All kinds of beans have a lot of iron and zinc that can help strengthen your hair with the necessary nutrients giving them the ability to withstand daily wear and tear.

Rajma Chawal is an Indian dish that is basically kidney beans served with a spicy curry. This helps in hair growth and renewal and helps rebuild the lost keratin that must be replenished as soon as possible.

You can combine it with the application of an anti-dandruff shampoo if you have extra dry hair followed by applying oil so as to retain glow and moisture.

### Protein-Rich Diets

It would be better if you can add red meats like mutton, lamb, and eggs that will help in getting an adequate amount of protein that is required for normal hair follicle development. These foods are rich in iron and help in the production of red blood corpuscles that helps in hair growth and maintenance.
