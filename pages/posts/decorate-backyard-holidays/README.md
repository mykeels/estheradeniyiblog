The holiday season is here and we couldn&#x2019;t be happier. Everyone enjoys festivities and people want to make sure that their homes look great inside and out. It&#x2019;s not just your living room that should be dressed up for Christmas, and if you&#x2019;re looking for ways to make your backyard more festive, you&#x2019;ve come to the right place.

We&#x2019;ve prepared a few examples of beautifully decorated yards which can help you find inspiration to decorate your own.

## Decorate your trees

If you have trees in your backyard, why not use them? Why should the only decorated tree be indoors? Get your hands on some oversized Christmas ornaments and hang them on the trees in your yard. Not only will the look charming, but you&#x2019;ll also make people stop by and admire your idea for sure.

If you want, you can also use old light bulbs too: cover them with glue and dip them in glitter. When they dry, tie a ribbon around them and hang them on the tree for a whimsical and festive look.

## **&#x2018;Burning&#x2019; bush**

Perhaps it&#x2019;s time you light up those cold winter nights with a little bit of art. Do you have a bunch of coiled old Christmas lights laying around in bags and boxes? If you get a headache just thinking about detangling them, you can use them as they are &#x2013; terribly tangled &#x2013; and create your own &#x2018;burning&#x2019; bush.

Simply place these lights on oil (or use a flower pot if you want) and put branches, twigs, and dried weeds to create a [bush-like appearance](https://www.bhg.com/christmas/outdoor-decorations/outdoor-holiday-decorating-ideas/?slideId=slide_c9a38a75-4331-43ba-8a9d-ba673f4c3414#slide_c9a38a75-4331-43ba-8a9d-ba673f4c3414) that&#x2019;s going to look realistic from a distance.

## Light up your pergola

Another simple way to make your home look festive on the outside too is to line it with Christmas and LED lights. You can line up the arches or your roof, but if you have some outdoor structures you can decorate them too. If you have pergolas and shades with modern PVC roofs like the ones [Pioneer Shade](https://www.pioneershade.com.au/) is famous for, you can even drape lights across it so it resembles a starry sky.

Brilliantly vivid Christmas lights will certainly brighten up the nights and make your home seem more inviting. If you decide to outline your home this way, the contrast with the shadow of the house will look striking.

## Make garlands

There is nothing that says &#x201C;Christmas&#x201D; quite like garlands that you make with our family. Not only will you get to spend some quality time together and channel your creativity, but you can make them from a lot of things. Classic garlands made of pine branches can easily be jazzed up with decorative apples, oranges, or even pineapples!

You can make beautiful, lush, evergreen garlands [with a citrusy twist](https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/trends/g2835/outdoor-christmas-decorations/) to add a pop of color to your front door, or you can make a bright red one using only apples. Pinecones and burlap are symbols of the season and you can add festive accents with a bit of bright red berries and plenty of glitters.

## Pretty porch

 Your porch might be sheltered but you can make the most its corners if you add a small table and place some candles and greenery on it. Top a small table with a patterned holiday towel, add a few simple white, red, and green candles, and a few pinecones. Complete the look with a festive holiday wreath and bucket of big candy canes.

Dressing up your yard for the holidays has never been this easy or convenient and you shouldn&#x2019;t shy away from using unexpected decorations and even making your own. There is nothing better than being able to look around you and feel happy with the work of art you created. When it comes to decorations and styles, you can be modest or go over the top, but the most important thing is to have loads of fun.
