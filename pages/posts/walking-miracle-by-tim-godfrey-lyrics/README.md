#### Walking Miracle Lyrics by Tim Godfrey

Walking Miracle

Talking Miracle ah ah wow

Look at me now what do you see?

Eh, I don&#x2019;t look like what I&#x2019;ve been
 through

Look at me now I wasn&#x2019;t given a chance

But God turned my life around

Everybody say

Look at me now, what do you see?

I don&#x2019;t look like what I&#x2019;ve been
 through

Look at me now, I wasn&#x2019;t given a chance

But God turned my life around

Am a product of mercy and grace

Highly favoured and so blessed

Am a product of mercy and grace

Highly favoured and so blessed

That&#x2019;s who I am!
