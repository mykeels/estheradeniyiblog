At the end of 2016, I did a review, [you can find it here](https://estheradeniyi.com/2016-in-review/). It was one of my worst years ever! My emotional life was a mess. I hoped to continue using the review format in years to come but *nah*, I want something else.

In 2017, I listed profound lessons I took away from that year. [You can check that here too.](https://estheradeniyi.com/5-profound-lessons-from-2017/)

This is going to be my longest yearly review just yet. I do not know how to summarize many of what I have to say about this year. 2018 has been extremely full.

## Spiritual Life

If someone told me that I would enjoy fellowship with God in a newer way, I would not argue but it&#x2019;s not something I would look forward to. I would not say that my spiritual life was entirely down before 2018 but it was dry, a chore and quickly becoming a routine.

Of course, I grew and did the regular but what happened to me in 2018 spiritually was exponential growth. I yearned to be with God and learn more spiritual truths I missed before now.

COZA is a blessing, I must say. The word lives in that church fam. Somehow COZA is perceived as one of the unserious churches in Nigeria. I cannot categorically say why but I presume it has a lot to do with how much of freedom is allowed. Oh boy, that&#x2019;s where I want to be. I don&#x2019;t want to be anywhere that kills and rubbishes my humanity. I want to be me in Christ.

## Career

I don&#x2019;t even know where to begin. I can&#x2019;t for the life of me believe how fast everything went in 2018.

I got another job in January 2018. I applied as a social media intern. So wait, there are questions, I know but I will summarize:

I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t like to work with Chemistry. I was beginning to build a new career in digital marketing and I knew that I needed to start from scratch. I was fine with it, really.

I remember the look on Tope&#x2019;s face when I told her I was going in as a social media intern. I was ready to start from the bottom again. I worked as the Content and Corresponding Officer at my former place of work before I left.

Somehow, the interview went in the opposite direction. I was to go in for a second interview for Search Engine Optimization Analyst. Like, fam. My SEO knowledge was so rudimentary and basic.

I braced up and took up the challenge. One thing must propel a man and this was going to be it, I swore.

I am approximately 12 months gone and I can&#x2019;t for the life of me believe how fast I grew. That was fast people. So fast.

I owe part of this speed to people who believe in me. These folks saw that I don&#x2019;t know how to stop and I was not going to give up without a fight. And so, I began to consume anything I could find on SEO.

I am still not where and what I want to be career wise but I have come really far. I have come so far I can&#x2019;t believe it myself.

## Relationships

First, I left my relationship of 2 years 8&#xA0; months at the fair beginning of 2018. Oh my, I thought I would not survive it. I knew the relationship was bad for me. I knew I had to do something about it but I was scared.

What if I don&#x2019;t find someone else? What if I remain single forever? How would I heal? How would he feel? Was this going to be fair? How would my parents handle the information?

On one of those days, something happened and it was divine. I will never forget that switch. It was divine, I will say it over and over again.

I was listening to [Michael Todd&#x2019;s series on relationships.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzsoBckyt2cEwFRDUzUbcUtfE1MNZiaGM) Wait a minute. I will take a break here to talk about this one. If you are single, in a relationship, engaged, married, divorced, widowed, whatever, you need to listen to all of the series.

I promise you with all of my heart that no matter where you are right now, that series is going to change your life. Even if you are in a relationship, don&#x2019;t be afraid to put what you have under the microscope. Allow what you have to go under the knife, don&#x2019;t be afraid.

By the time I was on part four or so of the series, the boldness, the peace, the strength and courage to walk away from the energy drainer fell on me.

From the moment I decided it was enough till I announced to him and finally closed that chapter, I was carried. The Lord carried me and I never had any moment of anguish. I could not believe it! I was stunned. That easy?! Just like that? Wow&#x2026;

I made really good friends in 2018. I met people who pushed me to now. Some of my friendships were strengthened, some of them were shaken (many of them survived still). I enjoyed the comfort, presence, love of a lot of people in my life.

I didn&#x2019;t lack good people around me in 2018. When I needed help, God sent me quality people. When I say 2018 is one of the best years ever, I mean it with everything I am.

## Blog

Firstly, I [migrated from Blogger to WordPress](https://estheradeniyi.com/why-and-how-i-migrated-from-blogger-to-wordpress/). You might click on the link to read my step-by-step process of migration. It was a very big move and I was very sceptical of what the effect would be on overall traffic, especially organic.

Secondly, I moved from 30K monthly traffic to 90-100K monthly traffic. This was the game changer for me. The exposure was great! This is approximately 1500-2000 blog visitors every day. That was a big leap for my blog.

## Finances

I started 2018 a broke human being. Oh jeez, it broke me. It broke me so much that I cried many times. How does a hard worker go broke? I worked so hard to build this platform and some of the other platforms I don&#x2019;t want to reveal just yet.

How does one work that hard and get nothing or too little to survive in Lagos. It&#x2019;s December 2018 and in just 12 months I moved from that place to this place.

I am not certain I should be describing this place but this place is a financial breakthrough. Of course, I am not where I want yet, lol

2018 has been a financially rewarding year for me.

&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2013;

To think that 2018 wasn&#x2019;t a planned year makes me all the more ready to allow myself to grow at reasonable paces in different aspects of my life.

I ended 2017 and entered 2018 with none of the popular resolution notes. I wanted to be free, to be even though intentional, flexible. I needed to allow God to walk me through step by step while I worked on myself as much as I could.

## 2019 in Preview

I am obviously not doing any of the resolution stuff for 2019. Just like I did at the end of 2017, I am going to allow the Lord to carry me, lead me and walk me through daily while I work on being the best version possible of my steps.

I will also set small short-term goals. A whole year is too far to plan in just one day.

## Overall propositions for 2019 however

1. Join the workforce of COZA or any other church that doesn&#x2019;t make it almost impossible to work for God in their community.

2. Steer clear of any impending romantic relationship that is likely to turn into a disaster. We can&#x2019;t always know but I am not going to see signs and continue. Sometimes &#x201C;hope&#x201D; is not the best virtue, common sense is.

3. Make some more money. Looking forward to being proactive about approaching advertisers and Influencer points. I have had enough approach me in 2018. I could quadruple my blog earnings if I approach others.

4. Go out more. Just have more fun generally. Would like to strike a balance between work and play in 2018.

5. Launch my online shop, finally. I have a range of products and services I already sell on the blog but the process seems too archaic and time wasting. I am setting up e-commerce on the blog.

6. Do some of the things I didn&#x2019;t get to do in 2018. Hints: fashion, driving, swimming etc.

This is where I want to say Thank you. I am glad to have walked through 2018 with amazing people. I look back and I am happy I am a Blogger.

Blogging has opened just too many doors for me, some of which are still in the works. Thank you for your love.

I wish us a blissful 2019, let&#x2019;s have some fun, shall we?
