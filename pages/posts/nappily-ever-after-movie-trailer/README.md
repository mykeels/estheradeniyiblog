I got a notification of the **Nappily Ever After movie trailer** in my Youtube Notifications the other day and I just told myself, enough of movie race. They did not born you to be watching movies. You better go and finish your work. But again, I thought, movies and church are the only things I do outside work. Why the guilt?

Still I discarded, I was going to see **Lara and the Beat** anyway. By the way, Seyi Shay killed it mhen. Who knew she was ordained to act? Back to Nappily Ever After, my colleague (this babe who always hunts me down with trends and current stuff started again.

Esther, have you seen the **movie&#xA0;trailer of Nappily Ever After**? I was like, oh my, this thing has come to haunt me! Horrific! I said no and until I saw it, she didn&#x2019;t let me rest. Next thing I got was a skype message from this babe. Ase, it&#x2019;s **Nappily Ever After trailer** link. Oh my gawd.

## Nappily Ever After Movie Trailer

Here is what I think: **Nappily Ever After** will force a lot of women to introspect and think about the ideology of perfection, the beauty of vulnerability and the attractiveness of originality. This movie will awaken a lot of us, we that have turned to some aspect of beauty for approval, for completeness, for acceptance.

With comedy, we should have a relaxed view of naturalism and all that it encompasses. Trust me, all [natural hair blogs will be buzzing with Nappily Ever After](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-6031053/Black-women-praising-Netflix-film-Nappily-After.html) days from now.
