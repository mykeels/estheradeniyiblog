Ndani TV&#x2019;s Skinny Girl In Transit Season 4 premieres on the 29th&#xA0;of September. This series powered by GTBank is coming back on your screens.

We expect something really cool with Skinny Girl in Transit Season 4 as we have had a lot of teasers up to this point. The last season of [Skinny Girl in Transit](https://www.estheradeniyi.com/ndanis-tv-skinny-girl-in-transit-my) ended like it was going to be the last of it. Mide and Tiwa closing the episode in the most romantic way ever gave us such illusion. Oh well, we can&#x2019;t wait to see what&#x2019;s next!

&#x201C;Directed by Bunmi Ajakaiye, who is also co-writer this season alongside Damilola Elebe, Skinny Girl in Transit Season 4 will feature regular cast members including, Abimbola Craig, Ngozi Nwosu, Sharon Ooja Egwurube, Chioma Okoli and Abisola Aiyeola. Also returning to the show this season are Ayo Adesanya, Ayobami Ayolola and Stephane Zabavy. There are also some major character additions, with Beverly Naya, Caroline King and Nobert Young joining the SGIT Family.&#x201D; &#x2013; [Y Naija](https://ynaija.com/skinny-girl-transit-season-4-back/?utm_medium=push%20notification&amp;utm_source=onesignal&amp;utm_campaign=ynaija%20push&amp;utm_content=ynaija%20%notification%push)Watch the official trailer for Skinny Girl in Transit Season 4 Below :
